  abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

  title = {Monitoring and Self-Repair in Speech},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {0010-0277},
  abstract = {Making a self-repair in speech typically proceeds in three phases. The first phase involves the monitoring of one's own speech and the interruption of the flow of speech when trouble is detected. From an analysis of 959 spontaneous self-repairs it appears that interrupting follows detection promptly, with the exception that correct words tend to be completed. Another finding is that detection of trouble improves towards the end of constituents. The second phase is characterized by hesitation, pausing, but especially the use of so-called editing terms. Which editing term is used depends on the nature of the speech trouble in a rather regular fashion: Speech errors induce other editing terms than words that are merely inappropriate, and trouble which is detected quickly by the speaker is preferably signalled by the use of `uh'. The third phase consists of making the repair proper. The linguistic well-formedness of a repair is not dependent on the speaker's respecting the integrity of constituents, but on the structural relation between original utterance and repair. A bi-conditional well-formedness rule links this relation to a corresponding relation between the conjuncts of a coordination. It is suggested that a similar relation holds also between question and answer. In all three cases the speaker respects certain structural commitments derived from an original utterance. It was finally shown that the editing term plus the first word of the repair proper almost always contain sufficient information for the listener to decide how the repair should be related to the original utterance. Speakers almost never produce misleading information in this respect. It is argued that speakers have little or no access to their speech production process; self-monitoring is probably based on parsing one's own inner or overt speech.
R{\'e}sum{\'e}
L'auto-correction dans le discours se fait typiquement en trois temps. Dans un premier temps, le locuteur contr{\^o}le sa propre parole et l'interrompt lorsqu'il rencontre un probl{\`e}me. Une analyse de 959 corrections spontan{\'e}es indique que l'interruption suit de tr{\`e}s pr{\`e}s la perception du probl{\`e}me, {\`a} l'exception pr{\`e}s que le locuteur a tendance {\`a} finir les mots corrects. Les r{\'e}sultats de cette analyse indiquent d'autre part que la perception du probl{\`e}me s'am{\'e}liore vers la fin des constituants. Le deuxi{\`e}me temps se caract{\'e}rise par des h{\'e}sitations, des pauses, mais surtout par l'utilisation de ce qu' on peut appeler les `commentaires r{\'e}dactionnels'. Ceux-ci sont li{\'e}s de fa{\c c}on suffisamment r{\'e}gulaire {\`a} la correction particuli{\`e}re qui est faite: ils sont diff{\'e}rents lorsqu'il s'agit d'une v{\'e}ritable erreur et lorsqu'il s'agit simplement d'une mauvaise tournure de phrase. La pr{\'e}sence imm{\'e}diate du probl{\`e}me est signal{\'e}e par l'utilisation de `uh'. Dans le troisi{\`e}me temps a lieu la correction elle-m{\^e}me. La bonne-formation des corrections ne d{\'e}pend pas de ce que le locuteur respecte l'int{\'e}grit{\'e} des constituants, mais plut{\^o}t de la relation structurelle qui existe entre le premier {\'e}nonc{\'e} et la correction. Cette relation est li{\'e}e {\`a} la relation correspondante entre les {\'e}l{\'e}ments conjoints d'une coordination par une r{\`e}gle de bonne formation bi-conditionnelle. On peut {\'e}galement sugg{\'e}rer qu'il existe une relation semblable entre questions et r{\'e}ponses. Dans ces trois cas, le locuteur respecte les contraintes structurelles de son premier {\'e}nonc{\'e}. Enfin, l'analyse d{\'e}montre que l'ensemble form{\'e} par le `commentaire r{\'e}dactionnel' et le premier mot de la correction elle-m{\^e}me contient presque toujours des {\'e}l{\'e}ments d'information permettant {\`a} l'interlocuteur de d{\'e}cider comment il faut relier la correction au premier {\'e}nonc{\'e}. De ce point de vue, les locuteurs ne produisent presque jamais d'{\'e}nonc{\'e}s qui pourraient induire leur interlocuteur en erreur. Ces r{\'e}sultats indiquent que le locuteur a peu ou pas du tout d'acc{\`e}s au processus de production d'{\'e}nonc{\'e}s; l'auto-contr{\^o}le se fait plut{\^o}t {\`a} partir de la compr{\'e}hension de sa propre parole int{\'e}rieure ou ext{\'e}rieure.},

  shorttitle = {Error Monitoring in Speech Production},
  abstract = {A theory of speech monitoring, proposed by Levelt (1983), assumes that the quality of one's speech is checked by the speech comprehension system. This system inspects one's own overt speech but would also inspect an inner speech plan ({"}the inner loop{"}). We have elaborated and tested this theory by way of formalizing it as a computational model. This model includes a new proposal concerning the timing relation between planning the interruption and the repair: the proposal that these two processes are performed in parallel. We attempted to simulate empirical data about the distribution of error-to-cutoff and cutoff-to-repair intervals and the effect of speech rate on these intervals (these intervals are shorter with faster speech). The main questions were (1) Is an inner monitor that utilizes the speech perception system fast enough to simulate the timing data? (2) Can the model account for the effects of speech rate on these intervals? We conclude that including an inner loop through the speech comprehension system generates predictions that fit the empirical data. The effects of speed can be accounted for, given our proposal about the time course of planning interruption and repair. A novel prediction is that the error-to-cutoff interval decreases with increasing position in the phrase.},

  abstract = {Psychology and cognitive neuroscience often use standardized tasks to elicit particular experiences. We explore whether elicited experiences are similar to spontaneous experiences. In an MRI scanner, five participants performed tasks designed to elicit inner speech (covertly repeating experimenter-supplied words), inner seeing, inner hearing, feeling, and sensing. Then, in their natural environments, participants were trained in four days of random-beep-triggered Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES). They subsequently returned to the scanner for nine 25-min resting-state sessions; during each they received four DES beeps and described those moments (9 \texttimes{} 4 = 36 moments per participant) of spontaneously occurring experience. Enough of those moments included spontaneous inner speech to allow us to compare brain activation during spontaneous inner speech with what we had found in task-elicited inner speech. ROI analysis was used to compare activation in two relevant areas (Heschl's gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus). Task-elicited inner speech was associated with decreased activation in Heschl's gyrus and increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. However, spontaneous inner speech had the opposite effect in Heschl's gyrus and no significant effect in left inferior frontal gyrus. This study demonstrates how spontaneous phenomena can be investigated in MRI and calls into question the assumption that task-created phenomena are often neurophysiologically and psychologically similar to spontaneously occurring phenomena.},

  abstract = {Many people have the feeling that they can hear a little voice inside their heads. This inner speech accompanies reading and writing and often co-occurs with activities that involve mental planning such as problem solving (Sokolov, 1972). Clearly, inner speech is ubiquitous in our mental lives, and so it is not surprising that it has played a large role in psychological theory. For example, it has been proposed that inner speech is a necessary accompaniment to thought and even that inner speech is to be identified with thought (Watson, 1919). Although these radical views of the relation between inner speech and thought are held by few, if any, psychologists today, there is, nonetheless, widespread assent that the voice in the head is important.},

  abstract = {Inner speech is typically characterized as either the activation of abstract linguistic representations or a detailed articulatory simulation that lacks only the production of sound. We present a study of the `speech errors' that occur during the inner recitation of tongue-twister like phrases. Two forms of inner speech were tested: inner speech without articulatory movements and articulated (mouthed) inner speech. While mouthing one's inner speech could reasonably be assumed to require more articulatory planning, prominent theories assume that such planning should not affect the experience of inner speech and consequently the errors that are `heard' during its production. The errors occurring in articulated inner speech exhibited the phonemic similarity effect and lexical bias effect, two speech-error phenomena that, in overt speech, have been localized to an articulatory-feature processing level and a lexical-phonological level, respectively. In contrast, errors in unarticulated inner speech did not exhibit the phonemic similarity effect\textemdash{}just the lexical bias effect. The results are interpreted as support for a flexible abstraction account of inner speech. This conclusion has ramifications for the embodiment of language and speech and for the theories of speech production.},
