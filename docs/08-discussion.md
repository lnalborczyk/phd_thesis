# Discussion and perspectives {#chap8}



\initial{S}everal lines of research have suggested that inner speech may involve speech motor processes. This work includes introspective and phenomenological studies, mental chronometry studies, motor interference studies, modelling work as well as neurophysiological and psychophysiological studies (see our short historical review in Chapter \@ref(intro)). However, the involvement of motor processes during inner speech is highly variable between individuals, tasks, and studies. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that inner speech comes in different *varieties* that may involve motor processes to a variable degree. We examined this idea by studying the involvement of the speech motor system during induced rumination, a negative and repetitive form of inner speech. In addition to shedding light upon the nature of inner speech, this work may offer new theoretical and experimental tools to assess the presence and persistence of ruminative thoughts.

## Summary of the results

As argued in Chapter \@ref(intro), the guiding assumption underlying this work was that (verbal) rumination may be considered as a form of inner speech. Honouring that assumption, we studied induced rumination with the tools and methods used to investigate the phenomenon of inner speech. In the first experimental chapter (Chapter \@ref(chap3)), we used surface EMG to assess the predictions of two competing views of inner speech production. According to the *motor simulation view*, inner speech would be similar to overt speech, except that final execution of the speech actions is inhibited. Therefore, it should be possible to record peripheral muscular activation in the speech muscles during inner speech. According to the *abstraction view*, the level of truncation between overt speech and inner speech would be higher in the sense that inner speech would not include articulatory features. Therefore, under this view, it is not expected to record peripheral muscular activation in the speech muscles during inner speech. We observed that the induction of rumination was accompanied with increased EMG amplitude in all facial muscles (i.e., orbicularis oris inferior, orbicularis oris superior and frontalis) as compared to rest. It should be noted that baseline recordings were performed after a relaxation session. We interpreted these findings as a corroboration of the motor simulation view, with the activity of the speech muscles increasing from baseline to after the induction, suggesting that rumination, as a form of inner speech, may involve the speech motor system. We interpreted the increased activation of the forehead muscle as a consequence of the negative content of rumination, as the frontalis muscle is known to be associated with the expression of anger and sadness. Additionally, in the second part of this experiment, we observed that a relaxation focused on the speech muscles was slightly more efficient than a relaxation focused on the arm in reducing self-reported state rumination. A few important limitations are worth keeping in mind when considering these results however. First, as we did not have any control group for the rumination induction, it is adventurous to attribute the observed effects to the rumination induction only^[More precisely, concluding $p$ on the basis of $q$ would be committing the "affirming the consequent" fallacy, known formally as $\frac{p \rightarrow q, q}{\therefore p}$. In other words, observing $q$ is insufficient to conclude $p$ because $q$ might have been observed for other reasons than $p$. In our situation, the EMG amplitude might have increased for other reasons than the rumination induction. For instance, it might be that the EMG amplitude was higher after induction only because we compared muscular activity after induction to a relaxation period (which might show a lower than usual level of muscular activity). Alternatively, the increase in EMG amplitude might be due to the fact that participants were doing something, in opposition to doing nothing (i.e., this increase may not be specific to rumination).]. Second, and related to our first point, the dissociation between the activation of the lip muscles and the forehead muscle may not be straightforward. Indeed, it might be that the activation of both sites was related to rumination as a form of inner speech, or that the activation of both states was related to negative affects only. This point echoes the recommendations of @garrity_electromyography_1977 discussed in Box \ref{garrity}.

To tackle these limitations, in Chapter \@ref(chap4) we sought to examine the differences between different forms of induced rumination that should theoretically involve the speech motor system to a different extent. We compared the EMG orofacial correlates of either verbal rumination or non-verbal (mostly visual) rumination. Unfortunately, self-reports of the modal content of the ruminative thoughts showed that our induction did not succeed in inducing rumination in different modalities. However, even when exploring the (a posteriori) relation between the modality of the ruminative thoughts and the facial EMG correlates, we failed to find the predicted relation between the two. Put simply, verbal rumination was not associated with more activity in the speech muscles than non-verbal rumination. Moreover, comparing two types of relaxation (as in Chapter \@ref(chap3)) revealed that, in contrast to previous results, the arm relaxation was slightly more efficient than the orofacial relaxation in reducing state rumination. Averaging the relaxation results of both chapters revealed that both relaxation have a similar effect on state rumination. The results of these two first empirical chapter therefore suggest that verbal rumination is not specifically accompanied with peripheral muscular activity in the speech muscles. However, it is unclear whether this result is dues to a poor sensitivity of the surface EMG measurements or to the fact that rumination is a form of inner speech that does not involve the speech motor system.

In Chapter \@ref(chap5), we sought to resolve that ambiguity by examining the reliability of our EMG measurements to detect peripheral muscular activity during inner speech production. To this end, we asked participants to produce two lists of nonwords, that were designed to induce either a strong activation of the lip muscles or a strong activation of the zygomaticus muscle. We recorded the EMG amplitude of several facial muscles during the production of these nonwords in inner speech, overt speech, and during the listening of these nonwords. Based on previous results in the literature, we hypothesised that surface EMG may be use to discriminate the content (here, the class of nonword) produced in inner speech. However, an automatic classification revealed that although we were able to discriminate content produced in overt speech, we were not able to discriminate the content produced in inner speech based on surface EMG measurements. This result stands in contrast with previous historical results but also to more recent results obtained by other teams. However, crucial differences between other studies include differences in the material used (e.g., surface vs. intramuscular recordings), the population (e.g., children vs. adults), or the general methodology (e.g., hypothesis testing vs. classification and optimisation). Despite this surprising result and the failure of the surface EMG methodology to "decode" the content of inner speech, the abundance of positive results in the literation still speaks in favour of the peripheral muscular components of inner speech and that it is possible to assess it using surface EMG. However, in order to avoid this potential limitation, we shifted in the second part of the present work to another strategy in examining the role of motor processes in rumination. More precisely, instead of recording peripheral muscular activation of induced rumination, we tried to directly interfere with the speech motor system to check whether this would affect verbal rumination.

In Chapter \@ref(chap6), we set up a critical test of the motor simulation view of inner speech (and rumination). Indeed, if the involvement of the speech motor system is necessary during inner speech and rumination, then a disruption of the speech motor system should disrupt (or impair) the production of inner speech (and rumination). To examine this idea, we compared the effects of an articulatory suppression task to a finger-tapping task, following a rumination induction, on the levels of self-reported state rumination. Our results suggest a similar decrease in state rumination following both motor activities, suggesting that rumination would not be a form of inner speech that would crucially depend on the activity of the speech motor system (it may not mean that the speech motor system may never be involved in rumination, only that it is not necessary). However, some important limitations make the interpretation of these results delicate. First, there were important differences between the two groups at baseline, possibly due do the rhythmic training proposed before baseline measurements. Second, the measure of state rumination consisted in one single non-validated scale (already used in Chapter \@ref(chap3)) and may not be a reliable index of state rumination. Third, as in Chapter \@ref(chap6), there was no control group to the rumination induction and any effect following to the rumination induction may not be specifically attributable to the rumination induction. Fourth, there is some evidence suggesting that finger-tapping (with the dominant hand) may also perturbs speech motor planning and may therefore not be the best control condition to articulatory suppression. We sought to overcome these limitations in the last empirical chapter.

Finally, in Chapter \@ref(chap7), we extended the experiment of Chapter \@ref(chap6) by comparing the effects of articulatory suppression (vs. finger-tapping) on rumination and problem-solving, another (more adaptive) form of repetitive thinking. To overcome the limitations of the previous experiment, we used a validated scale of state rumination and asked our participants to use their non-dominant forearm in the finger-tapping condition. We also made sure that our baseline measurements were not contaminated by any systematic effect in the protocol. The data collection for this experiment is still ongoing and given that sample size is very low (around 10 participants per group at the time of writing), we will not consider these results in the discussion section of the present thesis. However, preliminary analyses presented in the results section of Chapter \@ref(chap7) suggest that articulatory suppression may indeed interfere with induced rumination.

## Theoretical implications of the results

### Epistemological interlude

In order to fully apprehend the theoretical implications of these results, it might be useful to first clearly articulate the logical argument elaborated throughout the present work. In the first part (the EMG studies presented in Chapter \@ref(chap3) and \@ref(chap4)), the logical argument was as follows: *if* verbal rumination is a form of inner speech, *then* rumination should be accompanied by peripheral muscular activity in the speech muscles. However, going from the substantive hypothesis (verbal rumination is a form of inner speech) to the experimental prediction (i.e., connecting theory to observations) actually requires the use of *auxiliary hypotheses* or *assumptions*. Elucidating these auxiliary assumptions, the actual logical argument from the first part can be restated as follows^[We recognise that this formulation may still be incomplete as some additional auxiliary or instrumental hypotheses may still be incorporated in order to draw a more exhaustive picture of the argument.]:

- *Theoretical assumption ($T$)*: Verbal rumination is a form of inner speech

  - *Auxiliary hypothesis 1 ($A_{1}$)*: Some forms of inner speech involve the motor simulation of speech production
  - *Auxiliary hypothesis 2 ($A_{2}$)*: The simulation mechanism recruits neural networks engaged in (overt) execution
  - *Auxiliary hypothesis 3 ($A_{3}$)*: The motor commands generated during simulation are only partially inhibited
  - *Instrumental hypothesis 1 ($I_{1}$)*: Surface electromyography is a reliable tool to peripherally record partially inhibited motor commands
  - *Ceteris paribus clause ($C_{p}$)*: We assume there is no other factor exerting an appreciable influence that could obfuscate the main effect of interest

- *Prediction*: Induced rumination should be accompanied by peripheral muscular activity (EMG traces) in the speech muscles

In other words, we say that if the ensemble of premises $p$ (i.e., the conjunction of the theoretical assumption, auxiliary hypotheses, etc.) is true, it should follow that $q$ is true. Therefore, stating $p$ suffices to conclude $q$ (modus ponens), that is, $p$ entails $q$. To be even more precise, when we test a theory predicting that if $O_{1}$ (some experimental manipulation or predictor variable), then $O_{2}$ (some observation or measured variable), what we actually say is that this relation holds *if and only if* all the conjuncts above are true. Thus, the logical structure of an empirical test of a theory can be described as the following conceptual formula [@meehl_appraising_1990;@harlow_problem_1997]:

$$
(T \land A_{1} \land A_2 \land A_{3} \land I_{1} \land C_{p} \land C_{n}) \to (O_{1} \supset O_{2})
$$

where the "$\land$" are conjunctions ("and"), the arrow "$\to$" denotes deduction ("follows that ..."), and the horseshoe "$\supset$" is the material conditional ("If $O_{1}$, Then $O_{2}$"). $A_{t}$ is a conjunction of auxiliary theories, $C_{p}$ is a *ceteribus paribus* clause (i.e., we assume there is no other factor exerting an appreciable influence that could obfuscate the main effect of interest), $I_{1}$ is an auxiliary theory regarding instruments, and $C_{n}$ is a statement about experimentally realised conditions (i.e., we assume that there is no systematic error/noise in the experimental settings).

In other words, we imply that a conjunction of all the elements on the left-side (including our substantive theory $T$) does imply the right side of the arrow, that is, "if $O1$, then $O2$". From there, observing $q$ (where $q$ represents the right-side of the above formula) does not allow inferring $p$ (affirming the consequent fallacy) but not observing $p$ ($\lnot p$) allows inferring not $p$ ($\lnot p$) via the modus tollens. However, not observing $q$ does not permit to refute the substantive hypothesis $T$ alone. Rather, not observing $q$ only allows for the refutation of $p$, the *conjunction* of all elements described above (i.e., $T \land A_{1} \land A_2 \land A_{3} \land I_{1} \land C_{p} \land C_{n}$). Put formally, negating the conjunction is logically equivalent to stating a disjunction of the conjuncts [i.e., either one or the other of the conjuncts is false; @meehl_appraising_1990]. Therefore, not observing $q$ only allows for a refutation of $p$ to an extent that is function of the (im)plausibility of the other conjuncts in $p$ (i.e., $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $A_{3}$, $I_{1}$, $C_{p}$ and $C_{n}$). To sum up, failing to observe a predicted outcome does not necessarily mean that the theory itself is wrong, but rather that the conjunction of the theory and the underlying assumptions at hand are invalid [@lakatos_falsification_1976;@meehl_appraising_1990;@harlow_problem_1997].

Similarly, the logical argument from the second part (i.e., the relaxation experiments presented in Chapter \@ref(chap3) and \@ref(chap4) as well as the articulatory suppression studies presented in Chapter \@ref(chap6) and \@ref(chap7)) was of the following form: *if* verbal rumination is a form of inner speech, *then*, a disruption of the speech motor system should disrupt rumination. Again, this argument may be restated in a more detailed form as follows:

- *Theoretical assumption ($T$)*: Verbal rumination is a form of inner speech

  - *Auxiliary hypothesis 1 ($A_{1}$)*: Some forms of inner speech involve the motor simulation of speech production
  - *Auxiliary hypothesis 2 ($A_{2}$)*: The simulation mechanism recruits neural networks engaged in (overt) execution
  - *Ceteris paribus clause ($C_{p}$)*: We assume there is no other factor exerting an appreciable influence that could obfuscate the main effect of interest

- *Prediction*: A disruption of the speech motor system should disrupt rumination

In other words, using the same reasoning as before, we say that not observing $q$ only counts as a refutation of $T$ to an extent that is function of the (im)plausibility of the other conjuncts in $p$. The question remains to know how we could assess the plausibility of each conjunct in order to examine the validity of the substantive hypothesis. Interestingly, @strevens_bayesian_2001 discusses a Bayesian solution to this problem (known as the Duhem-Quine problem in philosophy of science). Reformulating the problem as one of assigning "credit or blame to central hypotheses vs. auxiliary hypotheses" [@gershman_how_2019], Strevens suggests a Bayesian framework for confirmation. Let $h$ denotes the substantive hypothesis, $a$ denotes the auxiliary hypothesis, and $d$ denote the data. After observing the data $d$, the prior probability of the conjunct $ha$ (i.e., $p(ha)$) is updated to the posterior distribution $p(ha|d)$ according to Bayes' rule:

$$
P(h a | d) = \frac{P(d | h a) P(h a)}{P(d | h a) P(h a)+P(d | \neg(h a)) P(\neg(h a))},
$$

where $p(d|ha)$ is the *likelihood* of the data under $ha$, and $\lnot (ha)$ denotes the negation of $ha$. From there, marginalising over all possible auxiliary hypotheses, the sum rule of probability allows us to obtain the updated belief about the substantive hypothesis:

$$P(h | d) = P(h a | d) + P(h \neg a | d).$$
Similarly, the marginal posterior over the auxiliary is given by:

$$P(a | d) = P(h a | d) + P(\neg h a | d).$$
To sum up, although failing to observe an outcome predicted by a substantive theory cannot count as a strict falsification of that theory, a Bayesian confirmationist framework permits to assess the plausibility of each conjunct separately and to guide the rational updating of knowledge in the light of incoming data [for more details, see @gershman_how_2019;@strevens_bayesian_2001]. In the next section, we revisit our results, keeping these concepts in mind, in order to assess the plausibility of each conjunct and the evolution of these plausibilities throughout the data we accumulated in our work.

A revised verson of @mackay_constraints_1992 constraints...

Condensation in rumination, look into think-aloud protocols (e.g. Lyubomirsky et al., 1999) ?

Différence entre petit effet homogène (dominant) et > effet hétéogène, réf aux travaux de haaf et rouder, further work should probably explore the domnancy of the effect

From Friston (2011): there is no need for separate inverse and forward models in motor control because the inverse model can be replaced by (Bayesian) inversion of the forward model […] page 491/ Active inference eschews the hard inverse problem by replacing optimal control signals that specify muscle movements (in an intrinsic frame) with prior beliefs about limb trajectories (in an extrinsic frame)  

From Pickering & clarke, IFM replace the need for an inversme model (AFM) ?

Computational modelling ? For instance, model of motor imagery duration (in relation to execution duration), maybe find some inspiration in Tversky & Kahneman (1992) model of probability of winning a gamble vs subjective probability ? Cf. description of the model in Farell & Lewandowsky (2018, p. 252-253).

Clarify the logical chain derivation chain from inner speech to EMG correlates (i.e., inner speech = motor simulation = rehearsal of the neuro-motor networks implicated in speech production = incomplete inhibition = EMG traces)

Posterior prob of central hypo and auxiliary hypo ? Computing them via Bayes theorem ? See Gershman (2018; p.15)

How to overcome (bad) mental habits ? From Hertel (2004, page 209): In short, the best antidote to maladaptive habits is a new set of habits—not the opposite sort of habits recommended by Pollyanna and the teachings of Norman Vincent Peale (1956) and not the habits of suppression as recommended by certain grandmothers but the habits of thought control.

Describe model of van vugt... suractivation of neagtive memory chunks ? Alternatively, rumination can be seen in a Bayesian framework as overdetermined priors… or lack of flexibility.

Mental habit = low control (automaticity). Habits become habits through learning and association, in the same way a poem can be learned by heart… both can be more and more strongly internalised in a similar way…

See fitzgerald et al. (2014): how habits are created ? Through model comparison and model averaging, simpler model (habits models) are favoured over time

From Dolan & Doyan (2014): Model-free control is computationally efficient, since it replaces computation (i.e., the burdensome simulation of future states) with memory (i.e., stored discounted values of expected future reward); however, the forward-looking nature of the pre- diction error makes it statistically inefficient (Daw et al., 2005).

>> More automatic inner speech relies more on associate memory-based processes while less automatic (more intentional / deliberate) relies more on deliberate simulation mechanisms. Why ? Because habitual motor action relies on memory-based stored association (mappings) between motor command and sensory consequences. 

In contrast, new (unusual) motor commands, to be imagined, needs to go through the simulation/emulation 
mechanism. This could be tested by creating habits (via learning) of differents words and comparing their EMG traces and / or suppression by articulatory suppression… For instance, mental multiplication ? Learned arithmetic table ? Poems ? Also see: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13421-013-0320-y.pdf

The condensation dimension might not be related to “embodiment” (e.g., EMG traces) as automatic thoughts vary along that axis… (e.g., an earworm).
