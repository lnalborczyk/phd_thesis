A revised verson of @mackay_constraints_1992 constraints...

Condensation in rumination, look into think-aloud protocols (e.g. Lyubomirsky et al., 1999) ??

Différence entre petit effet homogène (dominant) et > effet hétéogène, réf aux travaux de haaf et rouder, further work should probably explore the domnancy of the effect

From Friston (2011): there is no need for separate inverse and forward models in motor control because the inverse model can be replaced by (Bayesian) inversion of the forward model […] page 491/ Active inference eschews the hard inverse problem by replacing optimal control signals that specify muscle movements (in an intrinsic frame) with prior beliefs about limb trajectories (in an extrinsic frame)  

From Pickering & clarke, IFM replace the need for an inversme model (AFM) ?

Computational modelling ? For instance, model of motor imagery duration (in relation to execution duration), maybe find some inspiration in Tversky & Kahneman (1992) model of probability of winning a gamble vs subjective probability ? Cf. description of the model in Farell & Lewandowsky (2018, p. 252-253).

Clarify the logical chain derivation chain from inner speech to EMG correlates (i.e., inner speech = motor simulation = rehearsal of the neuro-motor networks implicated in speech production = incomplete inhibition = EMG traces)

Posterior prob of central hypo and auxiliary hypo ? Computing them via Bayes theorem ? See Gershman (2018; p.15)

How to overcome (bad) mental habits ? From Hertel (2004, page 209): In short, the best antidote to maladaptive habits is a new set of habits—not the opposite sort of habits recommended by Pollyanna and the teachings of Norman Vincent Peale (1956) and not the habits of suppression as recommended by certain grandmothers but the habits of thought control.

Describe model of van vugt… suractivation of neagtive memory chunks ? Alternatively, rumination can be seen in a Bayesian framework as overdetermined priors… or lack of flexibility.

Mental habit = low control (automaticity). Habits become habits through learning and association, in the same way a poem can be learned by heart… both can be more and more strongly internalised in a similar way…

See fitzgerald et al. (2014): how habits are created ? Through model comparison and model averaging, simpler model (habits models) are favoured over time

From Dolan & Doyan (2014): Model-free control is computationally efficient, since it re- places computation (i.e., the burdensome simulation of future states) with memory (i.e., stored discounted values of expected future reward); however, the forward-looking nature of the pre- diction error makes it statistically inefficient (Daw et al., 2005).

>> More automatic inner speech relies more on associate memory-based processes while less automatic (more intentional / deliberate) relies more on deliberate simulation mechanisms. Why ? Because habitual motor action relies on memory-based stored association (mappings) between motor command and sensory consequences. 

In contrast, new (unusual) motor commands, to be imagined, needs to go through the simulation/emulation 
mechanism. This could be tested by creating habits (via learning) of differents words and comparing their EMG traces and / or suppression by articulatory suppression… For instance, mental multiplication ? Learned arithmetic table ? Poems ? Also see: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13421-013-0320-y.pdf

The condensation dimension might not be related to “embodiment” (e.g., EMG traces) as automatic thoughts vary along that axis… (e.g., an earworm).
