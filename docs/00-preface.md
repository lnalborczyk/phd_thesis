\chapter*{Preface}

\initial{T}his doctoral work has been realised as a joint PhD between Univ. Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble, France) and Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium) and has been funded by Univ. Grenoble Alpes (previously UPMF). The present thesis is presented as a collection of eight chapters, with two introductive chapters, five empirical chapters and finally a discussion chapter.

In Chapter 1, we introduce, review, and discuss the main theoretical frameworks related to rumination, inner speech, and more broadly, motor imagery. In addition to theoretical concepts, we review the methods that have been used to investigate each phenomenon. For inner speech, we also provide a brief and non-exhaustive historical review from 1850 to present days. In Chapter 2, we provide some core technical details related to the methodology we used in our work. This chapter contains elements that could not be included in experimental chapters, such as a brief introduction to surface electromyography and a description of our statistical approach. Although these details usually do not find their place in empirical papers, we still wanted to provide the reader this complementary information that, we think, will facilitate the reading of subsequent empirical chapters.

In Chapter 3, we present an experimental protocol aiming to highlight the facial electromyographic correlates of induced rumination. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate whether an interference of the speech motor system (via orofacial relaxation) would disrupt rumination more importantly than a motor interference directed to another part of the body (an arm relaxation). Results of this experiment suggest that induced rumination is accompanied by an increased facial muscular activity (as compared to rest) and that an orofacial relaxation would be slightly more efficient in reducing rumination than a non-orofacial relaxation. However, as the increase facial muscular activity was not restricted to the orofacial area, it is difficult to conclude with absolute certainty that these activations were related to speech production processes.

Finally, in Chapter 8, we discuss the overall findings and suggest ways forward from both an experimental and a theoretical perspective. The underlying code as well as an online version of this is thesis is available at: https://github.com/lnalborczyk/phd_thesis.
