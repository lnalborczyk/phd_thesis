Such apparent functional equivalence supports the hypothesis that MI draws on the similar neural networks that are used in actual perception and motor control (Jeannerod, 1994; Grezes and Decety, 2001; Holmes and Collins, 2001)… 1.1.1 Simulation theories … 1.1.2 Emulation theories … 1.1.3 Action representation and internal models Voir Jeannerod (2004), Wolpert el al.

["rumination-as-simulated-speech.html", "Chapter 2 Rumination as simulated speech", " Chapter 2 Rumination as simulated speech As suggested by (???), rumination and other forms of spontaneous thoughts can be considered in a common conceptual space (see Figure 1). This space is built upon two dimensions: deliberate constraints and automatic constraints. These dimensions represent two general mechanisms that allow to constrain the contents of these related mental states and the transitions between them. The first contrain correspond to a deliberate processus and is implemented through cognitive control (???). The second constrain is referring to more automatic constrains like sensory afferences. In this framework, rumination is characterized by the highest level of automatic constraints and spread all along the deliberate constraints dimension.

At the cellular level, using electrophysiological measures like micro-electrods implanted in the cell, that allow direct measures of action potential. At the segmental level, biomechanis study muscular activity using surface sensors, positionned on the skin…intermediate levels… 3.4.2 Motor Unit Action Potential Motor unit action potential (MUAP) is the electric field resulting from the sum f the electric fiels emitted y each fiber of the motor unit. This train of action potentials will generate a train of MUAP, call motor unit action potential trains (MUAPT). The electric potential generated by this field is highly dependant of parameters such as the number of fibers, their length, speed of conduction and position of the neuromuscular junction.

In reason of the important… of facial muscles, the EMG activity of one recorded muscle generally does not represent the activity of a single muscle but rather a mixture of…(???)… 3.4.4 Basic signal processing …the EMG signal is a stochastic signal… In order to illustrate what EMG signal looks like, we simulated EMG signal based on a standard algorithm (???), implemented in R by (???). &gt; source(&quot;code/EMGfuns.R&quot;) &gt; emg &lt;- EMG_sim(n = 2048, sampFreq = 1000, lF = 10, hF = 100)$sim &gt; ts.plot(emg, xlab = &quot;Time (ms)&quot;, ylab = &quot;simEMG&quot;, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;) Figure 3.1: Simulated EMG signal. …we rectify the EMG signal by taking its absolute value and substracting the mean in order to correct for any offset (bias) present in the raw data. It is interesting to note that the effects of rectification on the EMG signal is similar to the rectification of AM radio waves whose purpose is to enhance the low frequency components, wich encode the voice signals. Concerning EMG, the “voice” of the signal corresponds to the encoded force (???). &gt; emg &lt;- abs(emg - mean(emg) ) &gt; ts.plot(emg, xlab = &quot;Time (ms)&quot;, ylab = &quot;simEMG&quot;, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;) Figure 3.2: Rectified EMG signal. … There are two main measures thant can be used to represent the magnitude of muscle activity. These two measures can be directly computed from the filtered EMG signal. The first one is the average rectified value (ARV): \\[ARV = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} | EMG(t_{i}) |\\] which is computed over a specific interval \\((0,T)\\) and where \\(|EMG(_{i})|\\) is the absolute value of a datum of EMG in the data window. The unit of measurement is \\(mV\\) or \\(\\mu V\\), and the ARV calculation is generally similar to the numerical formula for integration (???). The second one is the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude: \\[RMS = \\sqrt \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} | EMG^{2}(t_{i}) |\\] where \\(|EMG^{2}(_{i})|\\) is the squared value of each EMG datum and has both physical and physiological meanings… "],
