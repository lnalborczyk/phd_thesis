## EMG signal measures

Muscular activity can be studied at different levels. At the cellular level, using electrophysiological measures like micro-electrods implanted in the cell, that allow direct measures of **action potential**. At the segmental level, biomechanis study muscular activity using surface sensors, positionned on the skin...intermediate levels...
 
### Motor unit action potential

The **motor unit action potential** (MUAP) is the electric field resulting from the sum of the electric fiels emitted by each fiber of the motor unit. This train of action potentials will generate a *train* of MUAP, call **motor unit action potential trains** (MUAPT). The electric potential generated by this field is highly dependent of parameters such as the number of fibers, their length, speed of conduction and position of the neuromuscular junction...

To sum up, the EMG signal results from a mixture of recruited motor units...

### Basic signal processing

...the EMG signal is a stochastic signal... In order to illustrate what EMG signal looks like, we simulated EMG signal based on a standard algorithm implemented in the `biosignalEMG` package [@R-biosignalEMG].


```r
library(biosignalEMG)
library(tidyverse)

emg <- syntheticemg(
  off.sd = 1, on.sd = 2, on.mode.pos = 0.1, samplingrate = 1e3, units = "mV"
  )$values

ts.plot(
  emg, xlab = "Time (samples)", ylab = "Raw EMG signal (mV)",
  col = "steelblue"
  )
```

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{02-chap2_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1} 

}

\end{figure}

We usually rectify the EMG signal by taking its absolute value and substracting the mean in order to correct for any offset (bias) present in the raw data.


```r
> emg <- abs(emg - mean(emg) )
> 
> ts.plot(
+   emg, xlab = "Time (samples)", ylab = "Rectified EMG signal",
+   col = "steelblue"
+   )
```

\end{figure}

From there, two main measures can be used to represent the magnitude of muscle activity^[But see @phinyomark_feature_2012 for other features that can be extracted from the surface EMG signals.]. The first one is the **mean absolute value** (MAV):

$$MAV = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} | x_{n} |$$

which is computed over a specific interval and where $|x_{n}|$ is the absolute value of a datum of EMG in the data window. The unit of measurement is $mV$ or $\mu V$, and the MAV calculation is generally similar to the numerical formula for integration [@kamen_essentials_2010]. The second one is the **root-mean-square** (RMS) amplitude:

$$RMS = \sqrt \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} | x^{2}_{n} |$$

where $| x^{2}_{n} |$ is the squared value of each EMG datum and has both physical and physiological meanings...
