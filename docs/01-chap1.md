## Motor imagery

Considerable experimental evidence has accumulated to suggest that movement execution and MI share substantial overlap of active brain regions (for review, see Guillot et al., 2012). Such apparent functional equivalence supports the hypothesis that MI draws on the similar neural networks that are used in actual perception and motor control (Jeannerod, 1994; Grezes and Decety, 2001; Holmes and Collins, 2001)...

# Rumination as simulated speech

As suggested by @Christoff2016, rumination and other forms of spontaneous thoughts can be considered in a common conceptual space (see Figure 1). This space is built upon two dimensions: *deliberate constraints* and *automatic constraints*. These dimensions represent two general mechanisms that allow to constrain the contents of these related mental states and the transitions between them. The first contrain correspond to a deliberate processus and is implemented through **cognitive control** [@Miller2000]. The second constrain is referring to more automatic constrains like sensory afferences. In this framework, rumination is characterized by the highest level of automatic constraints and spread all along the *deliberate constraints* dimension.
