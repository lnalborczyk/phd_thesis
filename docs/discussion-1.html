<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>With this study we aimed to replicate and extend previous findings showing that induced rumination was associated with increased facial muscular activity as compared to rest <span class="citation">(Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. More precisely, we tried to disentangle the facial electromyographic correlates of induced rumination that were related to either i) rumination as a kind of inner speech or ii) rumination as a state of pondering on negative affects. To this end, we compared two types of rumination induction. The first one was designed to specifically induce rumination in a verbal modality, whereas the second one was designed to induce rumination in a visual imagery modality. Following the <em>motor simulation view</em> of inner speech production, we hypothesised that the verbal rumination induction should result in higher activity in the speech-related muscles than the non-verbal rumination induction. At the same time, forehead muscular activity should vary consistently (i.e., should not differ) across conditions, as both conditions were expected to induce similar levels of negative affects. Following the <em>motor simulation view</em> as well as previous observations <span class="citation">(Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, we also hypothesised that a relaxation focused on the orofacial area should be more efficient in reducing rumination (when experienced in a verbal modality) than a relaxation focused on a non-orofacial area (i.e., the arm).</p>
<p>To examine these hypotheses, it was crucial to first show that i) the rumination induction was successful in inducing rumination and ii) that the two types of rumination induction were effectively inducing different types of rumination (i.e., verbal vs. non-verbal rumination). Although our results show that the rumination induction was successful in inducing rumination (as expressed by the increase in self-reported state rumination), it failed to induce rumination in different modalities. That is, there was no difference in self-reported levels of verbal vs. non verbal thoughts, and no substantial difference in the facial EMG correlates across conditions. Moreover, even when defining groups of verbal vs. non-verbal ruminators a posteriori (i.e., based on the self-reports), these two groups were not discriminable by their facial EMG recordings. In addition, self-reported levels of state rumination were only (positively) related to the EMG amplitude of the forehead muscle (FRO), but were not related to the activity of the other facial muscles. In the second part of the experiment, comparing the two types of relaxation (either focused on the orofacial area or on the arm) revealed no difference in terms of their impact on state rumination, whatever the type of rumination induction participants went through. We discuss each of these results in the following sections.</p>
<div id="inducing-rumination-in-different-modalities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Inducing rumination in different modalities</h2>
<p>Based on the self-reports of verbal and visual thoughts assessed at the end of the rumination period (see Table <a href="results-1.html#tab:verbalvisual">7.3</a>), we observed that the verbal rumination induction resulted in slightly higher levels of verbal thoughts than the non-verbal rumination induction. However, both types of induction resulted in similar levels of visual mental images. These results are consistent with those of <span class="citation">Amit et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-amit_asymmetrical_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, showing an asymmetry between inner speech and visual imagery. More precisely, they observed that inner speech production (covertly generating a sentence) was systematically accompanied by visual images. However, producing visual images was less likely to be accompanied by inner speech. Therefore, we might speculate that although it seems possible to induce verbal rumination without inducing visual rumination (and therefore to manipulate levels of verbal rumination while keeping constant levels of visual rumination), it might not be possible to induce visual rumination without inducing verbal rumination.</p>
<p>However, the fact that we did not find modality-specific electromyographic correlates of rumination when contrasting a posteriori groups of participants still poses a challenge to the <em>motor simulation view</em>. In a recent attempt to bridge response styles theories of trait rumination <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a><a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> and control theory accounts of state rumination <span class="citation">(Martin &amp; Tesser, <a href="references.html#ref-Martin" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>, rumination has been defined as a mental habit <span class="citation">(Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. In this framework, self-focused repetitive thoughts (such as rumination) are triggered by goal discrepancies (i.e., discrepancies between an initial goal and the current state) and can become habitual behavioural responses to certain contextual cues. More precisely, rumination can become habitual through a process of “automatic association between the behavioral response (i.e., repetitive thinking) and any context that occurs repeatedly with performance of the behavior (e.g., physical location, mood), and in which the repetitive thought is contingent on the stimulus context” <span class="citation">(Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, habitual behaviours are more automatic that non-habitual behaviours, are less conscious content and are often less controllable. In other words, frequent ruminators do not willingly engage in ruminative thinking. Instead, rumination might be triggered by contextual cues such as a negative mood, without the explicit evocation of a goal (or discrepancy toward this goal). According to a recent neurocognitive model of inner speech production <span class="citation">(Lœvenbruck et al., <a href="references.html#ref-loevenbruck_cognitive_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, inner speech is considered as an action on its own (as overt speech is), except that multimodal sensory consequences of speech are simulated. This model also suggests that different forms of inner speech might involve the speech motor system to a different extent <span class="citation">(Lœvenbruck, <a href="references.html#ref-loevenbruck_what_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. More precisely, highly intentional forms of inner speech (e.g., subvocally rehearsing a phone number) are hypothesised to recruit the speech apparatus to a greater extent than more evasive and less intentional forms of inner speech. Accordingly, we speculate that rumination might be considered as a spontaneous (in opposition to deliberate) form of inner speech that does not require a full specification of articulatory features.</p>
<p>As such, we might actually not expect to observe peripheral muscular activity during rumination. If this hypothesis is correct, we need to explain the increased EMG amplitude recorded over the OOI after the rumination induction that was observed in this experiment but also in <span class="citation">Nalborczyk et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. Given that only the activity of the <em>frontalis</em> (FRO) was related to self-reported levels of state rumination (although this relation was rather weak), it is difficult to assume that the activity of the other muscles was related to rumination per se. In addition, the lack of a proper control condition (e.g., a distraction condition) prevents any causal conclusion to be drawn. Therefore, the most straightforward explanation may be that the increase in EMG amplitude recorded over the OOI might only appear in contrast to the relaxation state induced at baseline.</p>
<p>Finally, another explanation for the absence of modality-specific EMG correlates might come from studies using surface EMG to investigate inner speech production. As summarised in the previous section, our results do not support theoretical predictions of the <em>motor simulation view</em>, according to which it should be possible to discriminate the content of inner speech (and rumination) based on peripheral muscular activation. Nevertheless, the outcome of the present study is consistent with the results reported by <span class="citation">Meltzner et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-meltzner_speech_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. These authors were able to obtain high classification accuracies during both overt and mouthed speech but not during covert speech (despite the fact that they used eleven sensors on the neck and the lower face).</p>
<p>However, the results of <span class="citation">Meltzner et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-meltzner_speech_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> (and ours) stand in sharp contrast with classical results about the electromyographic correlates of inner speech production <span class="citation">(e.g., McGuigan &amp; Dollins, <a href="references.html#ref-mcguigan_patterns_1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>; McGuigan &amp; Winstead, <a href="references.html#ref-mcguigan_discriminative_1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>; Sokolov, <a href="references.html#ref-sokolov_inner_1972" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span> as well as more recent developments. For instance, <span class="citation">Kapur, Kapur, &amp; Maes (<a href="references.html#ref-kapur_alterego:_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> developed a wearable device composed of seven surface EMG sensors that can attain a 92% median classification accuracy in discriminating internally vocalised digits. However, these different results be explained by differences in the research methodology employed by these different teams (see discussion in Nalborczyk et al., <em>in preparation</em>). Indeed, the between-subject nature of the designs investigating the effects of induced rumination might hamper the possibility of highlighting modality-specific EMG correlates of induced rumination. Because (surface) electromyography is only a noisy indicator of inner speech production, decoding the content of inner speech based on such signals require multiple measurements per individual, and possibly participant-specific recording characteristics. Therefore, the lack of modality-specific EMG correlates might also be explained by a lack of sensitivity of the design we describe in the current article.</p>
<p>We think this possibility might be examined by looking at the results obtained in the second part of the experiment. If the absence of modality-specific EMG correlates is only due to a lack of sensitivity, state rumination should still be more disrupted by an orofacial relaxation than by a non-orofacial relaxation.</p>
</div>
<div id="modality-specific-and-effector-specific-relaxation-effects" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Modality-specific and effector-specific relaxation effects</h2>
<p>Contrary to our predictions, we did not observe the interaction effect between the type of rumination induction (verbal vs. non-verbal) and the type of relaxation (orofacial relaxation vs. arm relaxation). This null result also persisted when considering the interaction between the a posteriori cluster and the type of relaxation (see <a href="supp.html#supp">supplementary materials</a>). Moreover, BF-based hypothesis testing revealed no evidence for a difference between the two types of relaxation<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> (cf. Table <a href="results-1.html#tab:outputbmod5">7.7</a> and Figure <a href="results-1.html#fig:plotrelaxbsri">7.6</a>). However, looking in more details into the estimations from this model reveals that the arm relaxation was estimated to be more efficient than the orofacial relaxation in reducing self-reported levels of state rumination (BSRI scores). More precisely, the difference between the two types of relaxations was estimated to be of around 25 points on the scale of the BSRI sum score, although the large uncertainty associated with this estimation prevents any strong conclusion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these results are contradicting those of <span class="citation">Nalborczyk et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, who observed a stronger decrease in self-reported state rumination following the orofacial relaxation than the arm relaxation. However, it should be noted that both the results of <span class="citation">Nalborczyk et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> and the results reported in the current article are based on comparisons involving relatively low sample sizes (two groups of around 20 participants and two groups of around 40 participants, respectively). As such, these results should be considered at most as suggestive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the high similarity between these two studies warrants a meta-analytical way of thinking about their results. In other words, given that both studies used a similar rumination induction and the same relaxation recordings, we can compute an average effect size across these two studies to get a more accurate estimate of the population effect size. The effect size (pooled Cohen’s d) for the difference between the two types of relaxation was of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> = -0.498 (95% CI [-1.095, 0.098]) in <span class="citation">Nalborczyk et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> and of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> = 0.217 (95% CI [-0.216, 0.65]) in the current article. Because the current study has a larger sample size, the uncertainty (the width of the CI) about the value of the Cohen’s d is smaller. Therefore, weighting both estimates by their respective standard error reveals an average effect size that is very close to zero (<span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> = -0.052).</p>
<p>To sum up, we did not observe a stronger effect of the orofacial relaxation (when compared to the non-orofacial relaxation) and we did not observe the hypothesised interaction effect between the type of rumination induction and the type of relaxation. Moreover, we also did not observe an interaction between the type of rumination induction and the clusters defined a posteriori (see <a href="supp.html#supp">supplementary materials</a>). These results taken together corroborate the hypothesis formulated previously, according to which rumination –as a mental habit <span class="citation">(Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>– could be considered as a strongly internalised form of inner speech. As such, ruminative thinking would not <em>require</em> the involvement of the speech motor system. Therefore, rumination is not expected to be disrupted by motor interferences such as relaxation or articulatory suppression (Nalborczyk et al., <em>submitted</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Conclusions</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate whether rumination is better described as a form of inner speech that requires the motor simulation of speech production, or as a rather abstract and articulatory impoverished form of inner speech. In the first case, verbal rumination should be accompanied by an activation of the speech muscles and should be disrupted by motor interference directed at the speech muscles. To examine these hypotheses, we extended a previous study <span class="citation">(Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> and compared two types of rumination induction designed to induce either verbal or non-verbal (visual) rumination.</p>
<p>In the first part of the experiment, we replicated the findings of <span class="citation">Nalborczyk et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> by showing that both the activity of the forehead (FRO) and the activity of the lip (OOI) was higher than baseline after a rumination induction (averaging across the two types of rumination induction). However, we failed to find distinct EMG correlates when comparing the two types of rumination induction or when comparing two (a posteriori defined) groups of verbal vs. non-verbal ruminators. Moreover, only the activity of the forehead was related to self-reported state rumination. In the second part of the experiment, we did not observe the hypothesised interaction effect between the type of induction and the type of relaxation. More precisely, following the <em>motor simulation view</em> of inner speech production, we expected to observe a stronger decrease in self-reported state rumination following an orofacial relaxation than a non-orofacial relaxation, when rumination was expressed in a verbal modality (as compared to a non-verbal modality). This prediction was not supported by the data. Taken together, these results suggest that verbal rumination is a somehow impoverished form of inner speech that is not fully specified at an articulatory level.</p>
<p>We speculated that this observation might be explained by the degree of automaticity that usually accompanies rumination. Following the mental habit view of rumination <span class="citation">(Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, rumination can be considered as an habitual mode of response to contextual cues (e.g., negative mood). As such, it can be considered as a non-intentional (or weakly intentional) form of inner speech. Thus, the absence of modality-specific correlates of verbal rumination is congruent with the observation that inner speech is more strongly accompanied by peripheral muscular activation when expressed intentionally or under adverse conditions <span class="citation">(e.g., Sokolov, <a href="references.html#ref-sokolov_inner_1972" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Some limitations are worth keeping in mind when interpreting these results. First, the current sample only consisted of female participants. Whereas it permitted to maximise the probability of effectively inducing rumination, it also limits the generalisability of these findings. Second, although the rumination induction resulted in slightly different levels of self-reported levels of verbal thoughts, this difference was weak. Instead of <em>inducing</em> rumination in different modalities, a more fruitful strategy to compare the consequences of verbal vs. non-verbal rumination might be to induce rumination in the “preferred” modality of the participant. We might recruit participants with a propensity to ruminate preferentially in one of those modalities and present them with a classical rumination induction procedure. This would arguably increase the contrast between the two type of inductions and the probability of observing modality-specific EMG correlates, if any.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these results provide relevant information for both the study of repetitive negative thinking (including rumination) and the study of inner speech. On the first hand, the strong internalisation of verbal rumination speaks in favour of the conception of rumination as a mental habit <span class="citation">(Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. On the other hand, the modulation of the involvement of the speech motor system during inner speech by its degree of automaticity is congruent with previous observations. However, these results still need to be explained by and incorporated into integrative neurocognitive models of inner speech production.</p>
