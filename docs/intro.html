<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Theoretical framework</h1>

<p>s you read these words, you might notice the presence of an inner voice. This phenomenon, while occurring on a daily basis, usually remains unnoticed until we pay attention to it. However, if I ask you to focus on that little voice while reading these lines, you would probably be able to provide a relatively fine-grained description of this phenomenon. Whose voice is it? Is it yours? Is it gendered? It is usually possible to examine these aspects as well as lower-level features such as the tone, pitch, tempo, or virtually any sensory aspect. This first set of basic observations already provides us with some important insights. First, if we can think about our <em>inner speech</em>, then it should be something different from “thinking” itself (where thinking is used in its broadest sense to refer to any sort of mental episode). Rather, inner speech can be construed as <em>a</em> vehicle for conscious thought.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Second, the phenomelogical observations we can make about our inner voice reveal that inner speech is accompanied by sensory percepts (e.g., speech sounds, kinaesthetic feelings). It thus raises another set of fascinating questions about the origin and nature of inner speech percepts. Where do these percepts come from? Why do they look like the one we experience when we speak overtly?</p>
<p>This first set of questions refer to the <em>nature</em> of inner speech, that is, to <em>what</em> it is. In the present work, we are mostly concerned with these questions. Another set of issues revolve around the question of the <em>functions</em> of inner speech, that is, <em>what it is for</em>. The influential Vygotskian theory of inner speech development suggests that inner speech evolves from <em>private speech</em> (i.e., self-addressed overt speech) during childhood. As such, for the present purpose, we assume that the functions of inner speech are inherited from the functions of private speech via a process of progressive internalisation. The specific features of this internalisation process are worthy of investigation on their own (and we briefly discuss them later on). However, we are mostly interested here in the <em>what is</em> (i.e., the nature) question. Thus, we will only sparsely address the question of the functions of inner speech.</p>
<p>That being said, we think a lot can be learned about inner speech by looking at situations in which these functions deviate from their original trajectory. These <em>dysfunctions</em> are instances of inner speech where its (functional or adaptive) functions, such as problem-solving, self-regulation or planning do not work as intended. These dysfunctional instances of inner speech may include auditory verbal hallucinations <span class="citation">(AVHs; for a detailed investigation of the relation between inner speech and AVHs, see Rapin, <a href="references.html#ref-Rapin2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, where the sense of agency (i.e., who is the author of the internal speech) is impaired, or repetitive negative thinking such as worry or rumination, where the ability to control (or to disengage from) negative thoughts is impaired. In the present work, we investigate (some of) the psychophysiological correlates of rumination, starting with the theoretical assumption that rumination can be considered as a form of inner speech. Therefore, we study rumination as we would study inner speech, with the potential of refining our understanding of both rumination and inner speech.</p>
<p>Rumination has been implicated in the development and maintenance of several psychiatric disorders such as depression or anxiety. More precisely, rumination has been shown to be associated with the development, severity and maintenance of depressive episodes <span class="citation">(e.g., Treynor, Gonzalez, &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-treynor_rumination_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>; Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, &amp; Lyubomirsky, <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Given the central role of rumination in depression and the societal importance of depression (both in terms of lifetime prevalence and associated costs), rumination has been considered a key target in modern cognitive and behavioural therapies <span class="citation">(e.g., Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_rumination-focused_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. However, although rumination has mainly been studied in the framework of depression and anxiety, it has been suggested to be a key process in many other disorders <span class="citation">(e.g., Baeyens, Kornacka, &amp; Douilliez, <a href="references.html#ref-Baeyens2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Ehring &amp; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-ehring_repetitive_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Thus, rumination can generally be understood as a transdiagnostic process (i.e., a process that is not specific to a single disorder).</p>
<p>In this first chapter, we briefly review the main theoretical frameworks in which rumination has been studied. We then review the historical and contemporary conceptualisations of inner speech and suggest how rumination can be considered and studied as a form of inner speech. We then broaden the discussion by considering the analogy between inner speech and the more general phenomenon of motor imagery. Finally, we discuss how electromyography can be used (and has been used) to investigate covert actions (including inner speech), before moving to a brief introduction to the technical aspects of the present work (Chapter 2).</p>

<p>It is intuitively straightforward to understand how the repeated mental rehearsing of negative content might impair cognitive functioning and worsen negative affects. Repetitively thinking about why you were unable to solve that sudoku during breakfast might not make you feel better during the day. However, research on rumination suggests that the process of thinking (i.e., how we think) about a certain content rather than the content of the thought (i.e., what we think about) is a more accurate predictor of the cognitive and affective consequences of repetitive negative thinking. In this vein, rumination is described as a <em>repetitive</em> and <em>passive</em> thinking process that is focused on negative content. Whereas this definition is general enough to encompass several conceptualisations of rumination, it does not tell much about its functions or mechanisms. In this first section, we will review several models that have been proposed to explain the origin and role of rumination in psychopathology. We do not aim to provide an exhaustive review of the existing theoretical perspectives on rumination. Instead, we refer the reader to more extensive work (e.g., reviews or books) when appropriate.</p>
<p>One of the most prolific model of rumination is the response styles theory <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>. This theory was developed to explain the relation between rumination and depression, as well as to account for gender differences in the way individuals respond to negative affects. Indeed, it has been suggested that female participants would be more likely to ruminate in response to negative affects whereas male participants would be more likely to distract themselves. The tendency for female participants to ruminate more than male participants has been confirmed and quantified in a recent meta-analysis <span class="citation">(Johnson &amp; Whisman, <a href="references.html#ref-Johnson2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. According to the response styles theory, rumination consists of repetitive and passively thinking about the possible causes and consequences of negative affects. Thus, rumination is conceptualised as a mode of response to negative affects. Importantly, rumination is defined as an unconstructive thinking process, that is, a mode of thinking that does not lead to active problem-solving. Rather, rumination is thought to lead to a fixation on the problems and the feelings evoked by these problems.</p>
<p>The response styles theory suggests that rumination exacerbates and prolongs distress (including depression) through four main mechanisms <span class="citation">(as reviewed in Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. First, rumination has been suggested to “enhance” the effects of negative mood on cognition. This mechanism has been confirmed in experimental settings where rumination is induced and compared to distraction <span class="citation">(e.g., following the rumination induction procedure developed in Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_effects_1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. In these experimental settings, rumination has been shown to be associated with a negativity bias (i.e., a tendency toward negative interpretations) and to increase the recall of negative autobiographical memories <span class="citation">(e.g., Lyubomirsky &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-lyubomirsky_effects_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>; Lyubomirsky, Caldwell, &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-Lyubomirsky1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Watkins &amp; Teasdale, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_rumination_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>. Second, rumination has been suggested to interfere with problem-solving abilities. This has been confirmed in both dysphoric<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> participants <span class="citation">(e.g., Lyubomirsky &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-lyubomirsky_effects_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> and clinically depressed participants <span class="citation">(e.g., Watkins &amp; Moulds, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_distinct_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. Third, rumination might also interfere with motivation and instrumental behaviour. More precisely, one study shown that whereas dysphoric ruminators recognise that some activities might be beneficial for their mood, they are unwilling to engage in them <span class="citation">(Lyubomirsky &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-lyubomirsky_self-perpetuating_1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. Finally, rumination has been suggested to erode social support. For instance, <span class="citation">Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Davis (<a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_thanks_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span> shown that although chronic ruminators were more likely to reach out for social support, they reported less emotional support from others. According to the response styles theory, rumination is therefore maladaptive in that it worsens negative affects. In the first formulation of this theory, the adaptive alternative to rumination was thought to be <em>distraction</em>, during which the focus of attention is directed away from distress (e.g., by engaging in distractive activities such as sport or group activities). However, the adaptive status of distraction is still a matter of debate <span class="citation">(for review, see Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; LeMoult &amp; Gotlib, <a href="references.html#ref-lemoult_depression:_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--
This theory has been later appended... In the stress-reactive model of rumination, rumination is considered to occur after a stressful event. It has the advantage of explaining how rumination can appear in reaction to stressful events (even before the apparition of negative affects)...
-->
<p><span class="citation">Trapnell &amp; Campbell (<a href="references.html#ref-trapnell_private_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span> have later attempted to distinguish different forms of rumination based on their outcomes. They suggested to make a distinction between rumination and intellectual self-reflection. Whereas the later constructs is supposed to reflect a more adaptive component of the self-reflective process, empirical data on that question is not conclusive <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Treynor et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-treynor_rumination_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> have suggested, based on a reanalysis of a famous rumination questionnaire (discussed in the next section), that two components of rumination could be distinguished. More precisely, they obtained two factors coined as <em>brooding</em> and <em>pondering</em>. Brooding refers to more negative aspects of self-reflection and a focus on abstract questions such as “why me?” and was positively correlated with depression. Pondering refers to a more general self-reflective process, which might be more related to problem-solving abilities. However, pondering has been show to also be positively correlated with depression concurrently <span class="citation">(but to be negatively correlated to depression longitudinally, Treynor et al., <a href="references.html#ref-treynor_rumination_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Self-regulation theories of rumination <span class="citation">(Carver &amp; Scheier, <a href="references.html#ref-carver_self-regulation_1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Martin &amp; Tesser, <a href="references.html#ref-Martin" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span> suggest that rumination is triggered by perceived discrepancies between one’s current state and a desired goal or state. For instance, if a researcher has the goal of publishing her research in an academic journal but has virulent discussions with reviewer #2, she is likely to focus on and to repetitively think about the discrepancy between her goal (publishing the paper) and her current state (having endless discussions with a critical peer). In that situation, the self-focused thinking might end either when the researcher acts in the direction of reducing the discrepancy between the situation and the goal (e.g., by complying with the reviewer’s requests) or by giving up on her initial goal. In any case, self-focused thinking would therefore be instrumental, in the sense that it would help to resolve the discrepancy. However, the researcher might also continue to focus on the discrepancies between the desired state and current state in a passive way. In that situation, the discrepancy might persist and she might experience negative affects. Thus, self-regulation theories suggest that rumination can be either adaptive or maladaptive. In brief, rumination is adaptive when it leads to (efficient) problem-solving but is maladaptive when it does not lead to (efficient) problem-solving.</p>
<p>Another attempt to distinguish types of rumination according to their outcome has been developed by Edward Watkins and colleagues, building upon <span class="citation">Teasdale (<a href="references.html#ref-teasdale_emotional_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>’s work on emotionnal processing modes. The theory of processing mode <span class="citation">(Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_adaptive_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> makes a distinction between two types of rumination. The first type of rumination involves abstract and evaluative thoughts about oneself (e.g., thinking about the causes, meanings and consequences of). The second type of rumination involves nonevaluative and concrete thoughts about present experiences (e.g., focusing on the experience of). A number of studies have confirmed that different forms of rumination might be distinguished according to their adaptive or maladaptive outcomes <span class="citation">(for a review, see Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. These results constitute the solid theoretical basis upon which rumination-focused therapies have been developped <span class="citation">(e.g., Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_psychological_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_rumination-focused_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>So far, we have defined rumination as either a trait, a stable and habitual mode of response (response styles theory), or as momentary thoughts that are triggered by goal-state discrepancies (self-regulation theories). In other words, the former explains how rumination can be considered as a stable mode of response whereas the later explains how rumination might start. However, there has been a few attempts to integrate these two views in a common framework. One promising integrative approach has been proposed in the form of the habit-goal framework of depressive rumination <span class="citation">(Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. It has been suggested that rumination could be more explicitly considered as a <em>mental habit</em> <span class="citation">(Hertel, <a href="references.html#ref-hertel_memory_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. In classical conditioning and learning theories, a stimulus-response habit is formed when a response is repetitively associated with a stimulus (and when this association is reinforced). An important aspect of habits is their <em>automaticity</em> and the lack of awareness. Indeed, habitual responses are evoked “automatically” (i.e., without conscious effort) by contextual cues. Moreover, as habits are usually slow to learn, they are also slow to unlearn (i.e., they are relatively stable over time). The habit-goal framework considers rumination as a form of habitual response to goal-state discrepancies that occur frequently and repetitively in the same emotional context (i.e., depressed mood). Therefore, this framework permits to explain how rumination, while being originally triggered by state-goal discrepancies, might become independant of these goals through repetition. After learning, rumination might simply be “evoked” by contextual cues (e.g., negative mood). This would partially explain why rumination, as a habitual response, is particularly difficult to interrupt. This view of rumination also has implications for rumination-focused therapies <span class="citation">(see discussion in Watkins &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_habit-goal_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.2</span> Cognitive theories of rumination</h4>
<p>Another line of research is interested in the neural and cognitive correlates of the deficits and biases associated with rumination <span class="citation">(e.g., Joormann &amp; Gotlib, <a href="references.html#ref-joormann_emotion_2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Koster, De Lissnyder, Derakshan, &amp; De Raedt, <a href="references.html#ref-Koster2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. One of the central feature of rumination is its perseverative nature <span class="citation">(Mor &amp; Daches, <a href="references.html#ref-mor_ruminative_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Accordingly, (neuro)cognitive theories of rumination have tried to describe the cognitive mechanisms that are associated with rumination. These approaches try to answer questions such as: What are the cognitive underpinnings of the tendency to ruminate? What kind of cognitive biases does rumination cause?</p>
<p>As suggested by <span class="citation">Christoff, Irving, Fox, Spreng, &amp; Andrews-Hanna (<a href="references.html#ref-christoff_mind-wandering_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, rumination and other forms of thoughts can be considered in a common conceptual space (see Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:conceptual">1.1</a>). This space is built upon two dimensions: the <em>deliberate constraints</em> dimension and the <em>automatic constraints</em> one. These dimensions represent two general mechanisms that allow constraining the contents of mental states and the transitions between them. The first constrain correspond to a deliberate process and is implemented through <em>cognitive control</em> <span class="citation">(Miller, <a href="references.html#ref-miller_prefontral_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The second constrain is referring to more automatic processes like sensory afferences (e.g., visual or auditory saliency). In this framework, rumination is characterised by the highest level of automatic constraints and is spread all along the <em>deliberate constraints</em> dimension.</p>

<p>In other words, rumination is characterised by a strong automaticity, which is is coherent with the mental habit view of rumination discussed in the previous section. Interestingly, this conceptualisation of rumination… The cognitive control processes that are the most often investigated in relation to depression are i) inhibiting irrelevant content or a prepotent answer, ii) shifting between tasks and iii) updating current working memory content <span class="citation">(for reviews, see Mor &amp; Daches, <a href="references.html#ref-mor_ruminative_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Grahek, Everaert, Krebs, &amp; Koster, <a href="references.html#ref-grahek_cognitive_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Linville (<a href="references.html#ref-linville_attention_1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span> first suggested that deficits in attention inhibition may underlie rumination. This proposition was later confirmed and refined by Joorman and colleagues <span class="citation">(e.g., Joormann &amp; Gotlib, <a href="references.html#ref-joormann_emotion_2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; Joormann &amp; Vanderlind, <a href="references.html#ref-joormann_emotion_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Joormann, Yoon, &amp; Zetsche, <a href="references.html#ref-joormann_cognitive_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>, who shown that rumination is associated with biases in multiple inhibitory processes. In this framework, rumination is associated with inhibition deficits with mood-congruent (i.e., negative) material. More precisely, it is proposed that rumination is associated with decreased abilities to limit the access of irrelevant negative information (inhibition) and to discard negative irrelevant information (updating). In another model, <span class="citation">Koster et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Koster2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> proposed that rumination would be the result of a combination of impaired conflict signalling and attentional control. A conflict usually emerges when self-evaluative negative thinking is cued by internal or external stressors and conflicts with an individual’s goals. In that model it is an impaired ability to <em>disengage</em> attention from self-relevant negative information that explains prolongated ruminative thinking. This idea has been since largely confirmed by experimental work [e.g.,] as well as a by a recent meta-analysis <span class="citation">(Zetsche, Bürkner, &amp; Schulze, <a href="references.html#ref-zetsche_shedding_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Description, functions, nature…</p>
<p>Soviet psychology… Marxist psychology… Akhutina (2003) highlights a distinction between the study of inner speech (and speech production in general) in the west based on linguistics and chomsky work, and its origin in Marxist psychology in the east, where language is to be though in relation to its usages…</p>
<p>Vygostky essential properties of inner speech: i) abbreviation, the phonetic aspect is “diminished”, reduced, “In inner speech we do not need to pronounce a word in its entirety. We understand, by virtue of our very intention, what word we wanted to say… Strictly speaking, inner speech is almost wordless” (Vygotsky, 1956, p. 368). ii) predicativeness, “Psychologically, inner speech consists of predicates only”; “the subject of our inner reason is always present in our thought”; it is always implicitly understood (Vygotsky, 1956, pp. 364, 365), iii) it has a semantic structure of its own: predominance of <em>sense</em> over <em>meaning</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, it is idiomatic, agglutination of semantic units, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, for Vygostky, it follows that the passage from inner speech to overt speech consists not in simply “vocalising” inner speech but in <em>restructuring</em> inner speech (e.g., retrieving a yntax proper to overt speech, retrieveing the phonetic structure, etc)…</p>
<p>In the last chapter of this book, Vygotsky analyzes the relationship between thought and word in the mature mind. The central idea of this chapter is stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relationship between thought and language is not a thing, but a process, a continual movement back and forth from thought to word and from word to thought. Viewed in the light of a psychological analysis, this relation is a process that passes through a series of phases and stages, during which its essential features undergo changes that may be called development in the strict sense. Of course, this is a functional development, not development in the sense of aging; but the path traversed by thinking as a process from thought to word is development nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vygotsky ends this statement with his famous dictum: <em>Thought is not expressed in words; it comes into existence through them</em> (1956, p. 330)…</p>

<p>For Luria (1956), a verbal utterance usually starts with a <em>motive</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, that is something to express. For Luria, a veral utterance always starts with a <em>vague thought</em> and the role of inner speech would be to transform this though into speech. Three stages i) the motive ii) the thought and its transformation to inner speech and iii) transofrmation to external speech… in his studies of aphasia, Luria (1947) then recognises thateach of these stages can be (more or less) independently impaired)…</p>
<p><em>Copy-pasted from Akhutina (2003): The way was paved for this hypothesis by Soviet psychology and its notion of the multilevel structure of inner speech (Anan’ev, 1946, 1960; Sokolov, 1959, 1968). In Anan’ev’s view, one of the indisputable postulates of inner-speech theory is “that inner speech is a process that varies in terms of its readiness to be transformed into external speech.” For Anan’ev, inner speech has the following phases…</em></p>
<p><span class="citation">Watson (<a href="references.html#ref-watson_psychology_1919" role="doc-biblioref">1919</a>)</span> suggested that thought was rooted in (overt) speech, with maturation leading from speech to thought.. this hypothesis also applied to reading, with beginning reader overtly reading and progessively silently reading…</p>
<p>See reed 1916 for an historical perspective… this initial suggestion (by watson) lead to a fruitful line of research about the muscular bases and/or correlates of thought and inner speech…for instance, Reed (1916) observed that participnts were moving their tongue and lips (and sometimes whispering) while reading…</p>
<p>In a small monograph, <span class="citation">Stricker (<a href="references.html#ref-stricker_studien_1880" role="doc-biblioref">1880</a>)</span> reported that… however, Paulhan (1886) replied that he was able to produce (innerly) the vowel 1 and maintan the image of other vowels and that he was able to imagine the sound of any vowel without motor actions or feelings (images). Maybe this debats illustrates the limitations of the introspective method…which gives birht to experimental methods atthe beginning of the last century… for instance reed (1916) desrbies an apparatus to examine tongue movements (see Figure XX) and an experiment to examine the inovlvment of inner spech (and speech motor processes) in thinking…</p>

<p>The discussion of inner speech in soviet Psychology resolved mostly around the issue of the functions of inner speech. The work of Lev Vygotsky and PP Blonsky (for instance) culminted in si suggesting that inner speech is speech “to oneself” and “for oneself”. Interestingly, Vygotsky rejected both the verbal memory view of inner speech (i.e., inner speech is simply the retrieval of acoustic, optic or motor images of words) and the behaviourist view of inner speech as merely a soundless form ox external speech (à la Watson). For Vygotsy, the most dtermining factors of inner speech are its semantic features…</p>
<p>Concerning the development of inner speech, Vygostky considered that inner speech likely dervies from the <em>egocentric speech</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> of the preschool child. This lead Vygostky to claim a functional equivalence between egocentric speech and internal speech, the later resulting from a progressive internalisation of the former…</p>

<p><span class="citation">Sokolov (<a href="references.html#ref-sokolov_inner_1972" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span> provided seminal observations that inner speech is involved during reading, to an extent that is diretly related to the difficulty of the ongoing reading task. More precisely, he observed that the more difficult the task was, the stronger the “speech motor impulses” (EMG amplitude) in the speech muscles. Moreover, the difficulty of the task was also related to the abbreviateness of inner speech. Simpler reading tasks were associated with abbrevaiated (condensed) inner speech whereas difficult tasks were associates with “unfolded” (expanded) inner speech, and sometimes externalised (overt) speech… <span class="citation">Sokolov (<a href="references.html#ref-sokolov_inner_1972" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span> also show shown that, reciprocally, restrictiing the articulators of the participants (e.g., by clamping the tongue or lips) impaired the ability of the participants to complete the task…</p>

The two actions might seem very different, partly because of differences in the degree of automaticity. Imagining raising our arm might need a voluntary/deliberate/conscious (choose a word) intention (i.e., I want to raise my arm &gt; I raise my arm) while speech imagery (i.e., inner speech) seems more automatic: we do not expression consciously the intention to speak, we just speak…</p>

In adult humans, its covert counterpart (i.e., <em>inner speech</em> or <em>verbal imagery</em>) has developed to allow the full reconstruction of usual overt speech situations. In the same way as visual imagery allows to mentally examine visual scenes, <em>verbal imagery</em> can be used as an internal tool, allowing –amongst other things– to rehearse or to prepare past and future speech situations <span class="citation">(for a review, see Perrone-Bertolotti, Rapin, Lachaux, Baciu, &amp; Lœvenbruck, <a href="references.html#ref-Perrone-Bertolotti2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. In consideration of its self-evident motoric nature, a parallel can be drawn between verbal imagery and other forms of motor imagery (e.g., imagined walking or imagined writing). As such, inner speech studies might benefit from insights gained from the study of motor imagery and the field of motor cognition <span class="citation">(e.g., Haggard, <a href="references.html#ref-haggard_conscious_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>; Jeannerod, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The process of speech internalisation might be similar the inernalisation of any kind of motor action. Considering inner speech as any other form of morot action brings some interesting insights. If speech production can be broadly described as the coordinated motion of (groups of) muscles that result in some predictable sensory consequences (e.g.,, auditory, visual, kinesthesic or somesthesic feelings), then it can be compared to other forms of action. In that sense, the process of speech internalisation, as the process of “internalised walking”, might follow the same general steps. This process can be broadly defined as the learning of the mapping between some muscular command or patterns of muscular commands and the associated sensory consequences. Learning these associations result in the elaboration of an internal model of the mapping, that permit to predict ongoing actions, but also to simulate these actions in the absence of any overt movement. In that sense, the process of inner speech might be considered under the broad category of imagined actions…</p>
<p>Let’s consider the analogy between speaking and playing an instrument (e.g., the piano). Learning how to play piano can be reduced to the learning and coordination of complex and fine motor sequences, that in turn produce sensory (kinestheatic, auditory, visual, etc) feedback to the producer of the action (the agent). It seems that (from a certain level of analysis), the act of speech can be paralleled with the act of playing an instrument in that it consists in the coordination of infinitely complex movements that result in some modifications in the environment, that in turn generate sensory feedbacks for the agent. Thus, pursuing the analogy, we could argue that imagining playing an instrument and imagining speaking (i.e., producing inner speech) might rest on similar mechanisms (e.g., see O’Shea &amp; Moran, 2018).</p>
<p>This view is somehow consistent with the Vygotskian view of inner speech as internalised egocentric (or private) speech but it proposes a formal mechanism to explain it…</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> The motor simulation theory</h3>
<p>In his seminal paper, <span class="citation">Jeannerod (<a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_representing_1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> introduces the idea of a close functional equivalence between motor imagery and motor preparation, as suggested by the similar neural and physiological correlates observed in both imaging and preparing (and by the effects of motor imagery on motor learning and training). According to Jeannerod, actions are driven by an “internally represented world rather than directly by the external world” (page 187). In the next paragraph(s), Jeannerod seems to equate motor representations with motor images or what he calls <em>pragmatic representations</em> (page 187). For Jeannerod, motor imagery is a part of a broader phenomenon (the motor representation) related to intending and preparing movements (page 189). He also echoes the distinction (coming from sport psychology) between <em>internal</em> (imagining an action from the first perspective, which would be more kinesthesic) and <em>external imagery</em> (imagining an action from the third perspective, which would be more visual). For him, motor imagery necessarily belongs to the former type (page 189), whereas the term of <em>motor imagery</em> in sport psychology seems to more broadly ecnompasse both first-person and third-person motor imagery [e.g.,].</p>
<p>Motor preparation is unconscious while motor imagery is conscious. However, Jeannerod suggests that the difference between the two might be a difference of degree, rather than one of kind, as the difference between the two would only be determined by the time spent on each (i.e., if one makes motor preparation lasting for longer than it’s usually needed, it can “become” motor imagery, page 190). In plain words, the idea is that motor representations/intentions become known to the subject when they are not followed by execution (page 190), so there would be a continuum between motor preparation and motor imagery.</p>
<p>EMG lines of evidence page 191: Eye movements have been recorded during the recall of visual scenes (e.g., Jeannerod &amp; Mouret 1962). Jacobson (1930) first suggested that muscles were selectively activated during imagined action. Shaw (1940) reported that during imagined weight lifting, electromyographic (EMG) activity of forearm muscles increased linearly with the magnitude of the weight, etc.</p>
<p>Neural structures and physiological correlates page 192-193.</p>
<p>Evidence from mental chronometry and temporal equivalence (e.g., Landauer, 1962), showing that it takes approximately the same amount of time to say the alphabet or series of numbers aloud and to think them to himself.</p>
<p>The famous walking + load experiment of <span class="citation">Decety, Jeannerod, &amp; Prablanc (<a href="references.html#ref-decety_timing_1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> reveals that force, rather than duration, is the encoded variable, and that estimated duration is merely derived from the level of centrally represented force. When the subjects carried the load, they centrally programmed a greater force to overcome any resistance, because subjects did not actually walk (page 194). For Jeannerod, the programming of force as a subjective correlate: the sensation of effort, which can become perceptible to the actor independently of overt movement execution and can be monitored experimentally (page 194). Page 196: representation of kinematic regularities (e.g., Fitts’ law, Viviani’s experiments, etc.).</p>
<p>In the following (section 5, starting page 197), Jeannerod develops the idea that the goal of an action includes an internal representation of both the external object toward which it is directed and the final state of the organism when that object has been reached. Then, he develops on the idea of a distinction between a pragmatic mode and a semantic mode (page 198). He also makes a distinction between two functions of representations: a sensory one (to extract from the external world the attributes of objects or situations that are relevant to a given action) and a motor one (to encode some aspects of that action) (page 199).</p>
<p>NB: in this paper (Jeannerod, 1994), there is no explicit mention of a “simulation” process… Jeannerod only discusses the conscious access to the content of a representation, and defines it as motor imagery (cf. notes above as well as the distinction drawn by Grush, 2004). Interestingly, in the commentaries, Morton suggests that many of the cases Jeannerod reports are actually instances of simulations, rather than mere imagination, because these cases contain part of what would be involved in actual performance (page 215). In his response, Jeannerod seems to agree with and to endorse this view (e.g., page 231).</p>
<p>In the commentary of this paper Gursh suggests that… (Motor models as steps to higher cognition (Rick Grush)) there should exist an inverse model, and points that nothing mentioned in the target article is actually capable of generating mental imagery. For Grush, this inverse model would act centrally, taking as input the efferent copy (for instance) and would output a mock version of the afferent signals the peripheral system would have produced given the same input (i.e., an emulator, see page 209).</p>
<p>For <span class="citation">Jeannerod (<a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_mental_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, motor imagery is necessarily first-perspective. Third perspective imagery is imagery, but not MOTOR imagery… Motor representations are conceived here as ‘internal models’ of the goal of an action.</p>
<p>In <span class="citation">Jeannerod (<a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_neural_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>, “Covert and overt stages thus represent a continuum, such that overtly executed action implies the existence of a covet stage, whereas a covert action does not necessarily turns out into an overt action” (page S103). Jeannerod introduces the term S-states to designate mental stats which involve an action content and where brain activity can be shown to simulate that observed during the same, executed, action. These S-states correspond to intended action, imagined action, and many others (see Table 1, page S104).</p>
<p>In <span class="citation">Jeannerod (<a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, The Simulation Hypothesis of Motor Cognition (pages 129-164). See Schematic summary of motor simulation according to Jeannerod (page 133).</p>
<p>“Simulation is used here as the off-line rehearsal of neural networks involved in specific operations such as perceiving or acting (page 129). According to our view […], the simulation relates not to complete actions but to unspecific elements that comprise actions. Motor representations are automatically assembled in response to immediate task requirements and do not rely on memorized actions (page 134).”</p>
<p>The peripheralist versus centralist interpretation of physiological inner speech correlates (page 153): Subvocal speech was first interpreted as a source of peripheral kinesthetic information which, when projected to central nervous structures, generated auditory images of the corresponding words. The same interpretation was given to the low intensity EMG recorded during mental motor imagery of limb actions, which was thought to be the origin of the feelings experienced by the subject during mental rehearsal (Jacobson 1930), or to the eye movements recorded during mental visual imagery (e.g. Brandt and Stark, 1997). However, this interpretation of mental processes as consequences of peripheral feedback is now disproved by recent experiments showing complete absence of muscular activity in many subjects during motor imagery. When present, this activity is rather assumed to be a consequence of incomplete inhibition of motor output during mental states involving motor simulation. This same interpretation might also hold for inner speech.</p>
<p>Motor imagery can be defined as the mental process by which one rehearses a given action, without engaging in the physical movements involved in this particular action. One of the most influential theoretical explanation of this broad phenomenon, the <em>motor simulation theory</em> <span class="citation">(MST, Jeannerod, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_representing_1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_neural_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, contains the three following postulates at its core: i) there exists a continuum between the covert (the mental representation) and the overt execution of an action, ii) action representations can operate off-line, via a <em>simulation</em> mechanism, and iii) covert actions rely on the same set of mechanisms as the overt actions they simulate, except that execution is inhibited <span class="citation">(O’Shea &amp; Moran, <a href="references.html#ref-oshea_does_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In this framework, the concept of simulation refers to the “offline rehearsal of neural networks” <span class="citation">(Jeannerod, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, and motor imagery is conceptualised as a simulation of the covert stage of the same executed action <span class="citation">(O’Shea &amp; Moran, <a href="references.html#ref-oshea_does_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. The MST shares some similarities with the theories of embodied and grounded cognition <span class="citation">(Barsalou, <a href="references.html#ref-Barsalou2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> in that both allow to account for the phenomenon of motor imagery by appealing to a simulation mechanism. However, the concept of simulation in grounded theories is assumed to be multi-modal (not just motoric) and to operate in order to achieve a particular abstract knowledge <span class="citation">(O’Shea &amp; Moran, <a href="references.html#ref-oshea_does_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, which is not the concern of the MST<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The MST is supported by a wealth a findings, going from mental chronometry studies showing that the time taken to perform an action is often found to be similar to the time needed to imagine the corresponding action <span class="citation">(though not always, see Glover &amp; Baran, <a href="references.html#ref-glover_motor-cognitive_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>, for a review of controversial findings and for an alternative conceptualisation of motor imagery)</span>, to neuroimaging and neurostimulation studies showing that both motor imagery and overt actions tend to recruit similar frontal, parietal and sub-cortical regions <span class="citation">(e.g., Hétu et al., <a href="references.html#ref-hetu_neural_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Jeannerod, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_neural_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>. The involvement of the motor system during motor imagery is also supported by repeated observations of autonomic responses and peripheral muscular activity during motor imagery (we discuss these observations in section XX).</p>

<div id="emulation-and-internal-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Emulation and internal models</h3>
<p>NB: in this paper emulator is used as a synonym for “forward models” (pages 378-379)…</p>
<p><span class="citation">Grush (<a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> proposes a unified framework for explaining a wide variety of representational functions of the brain: the emulation theory of representation. This theory has its origins in control theory (forward models) and signal processing (Kalman filters).</p>
<p>Difference between emulation theory of motor imagery and simulation theory à la Jeannerod (pages 384-385): “[…] Given these definitions, it should be clear that the simulation theory and the emulation theory are not at all the same thing. They agree that the efferent motor centers are active during imagery. The simulation theory takes this by itself to be sufficient for motor imagery; the emulation theory does not, and claims that in addition, an emulator of the musculoskeletal system is needed and imagery is produced when the efferent motor centers drive this emulator. This distinction should be entirely obvious. To make an analogy: The emulation theory claims that motor imagery is like a pilot sitting in a flight simulator, and the pilot’s efferent commands (hand and foot movements, etc.) are translated into faux “sensory” information (instrument readings, mock visual display) by the flight simulator which is essentially an emulator of an aircraft. The simulation theory claims that just a pilot, moving her hands and feet around but driving neither a real aircraft nor a flight simulation, is sufficient for mock sensory information."</p>
<p>Distinguishing between simulation and emulation theories (page 385): “[…] The only way to get from the former (signals in motor format) to the latter (signals in proprioceptive and kinesthetic format) is to run the motor signal through something that maps motor plans/signals to proprioception and kinesthesis. And the two possibilities are (a) the body (yielding real proprioception and kinesthesis), and (b) a body emulator (yielding faux proprioception and kinesthesis) […] A motor plan is one thing, a sequence of proprioception and kinesthesis is another. The simulation theorist conflates them.”</p>
<p>In <span class="citation">Moulton &amp; Kosslyn (<a href="references.html#ref-moulton_imagining_2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, In brief: they tried to characterize mental imagery as an information processing system, considering it in the perspective of Marr’s three levels of explanation (i.e., the computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels).</p>
<p>Imagery is also characterized by its reliance on perceptual representations and activation of perceptual brain systems. We use this conception of imagery to argue that all imagery is simulation— more specifically, it is a specific type of simulation in which the mental processes that ‘run’ the simulation emulate those that would actually operate in the simulated scenario. This type of simulation, which we label emulation, has benefits over other types of simulations that merely mimic the content of the simulated scenario.
They note (page 1273): “[…] ‘motor imagery’ (which actually appears to be proprioceptive or kinaesthetic imagery—one experiences the bodily sensations of movement, not the movement commands themselves: Jeannerod, 1994).”</p>
<p>A second class of explanatory models of motor imagery are concerned with the phenomenon of <em>emulation</em> and with <em>internal models</em> <span class="citation">(see Gentsch, Weber, Synofzik, Vosgerau, &amp; Schütz-Bosbach, <a href="references.html#ref-gentsch_towards_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>, for a review of the similarities and dissimilarities of simulation and emulation models)</span>.</p>
<p>Internal model theories share the postulate that the motor system is represented by <em>internal models</em>, whose function is to estimate and anticipate the outcome of a motor command. One of its variant, the <em>motor control theory</em> <span class="citation">(e.g., Kawato, <a href="references.html#ref-kawato_internal_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>; Wolpert et al., <a href="references.html#ref-wolpert_internal_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, assumes two kind of models: a forward model that predicts the sensory consequences of motor commands from efference copies, and an inverse model that calculates the feed-forward motor commands from the desired movement <span class="citation">(Gentsch et al., <a href="references.html#ref-gentsch_towards_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Emulation theories <span class="citation">(e.g., Grush, <a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; Moulton &amp; Kosslyn, <a href="references.html#ref-moulton_imagining_2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> borrow from both previously discussed framework (i.e., simulation theories and internal model theories) to posit a specific kind of simulation. While the MST postulates that during simulation the motor system is guided exclusively by internal motor representations, the emulation theories suggest that both motor and sensory systems are emulated in parallel <span class="citation">(Grush, <a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; O’Shea &amp; Moran, <a href="references.html#ref-oshea_does_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the emulation model proposed by <span class="citation">Grush (<a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, the <em>emulator</em> is a device that implements the same input-output function as the body (i.e., the musculoskeletal system and relevant proprioceptive/kinaesthetic systems). When the emulator receives a copy of the control signal (which is also sent to the body), it produces an output signal (the emulator feedback), identical or similar to the feedback signal produced by the body<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. This feedback would be responsible for the presence of sensory percepts (e.g., visual, auditory, kinaesthetic) during motor imagery.</p>
<p>One important difference between the emulation theory of motor imagery and the MST though, is that the latter takes the mere activation of efferent motor centres as being sufficient for explaining motor imagery, while the emulation theory postulates that an emulator of the musculoskeletal system is needed <span class="citation">(Grush, <a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>, pp. 384–385)</span>. <span class="citation">Grush (<a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> suggested an analogy to illustrate this difference: “The emulation theory claims that motor imagery is like a pilot sitting in a flight simulator, and the pilot’s efferent commands (hand and foot movements, etc.) are translated into faux “sensory” information (instrument readings, mock visual display) by the flight simulator which is essentially an emulator of an aircraft.

As suggested by <span class="citation">Jeannerod (<a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_representing_1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>, the incomplete inhibition of the motor commands would provide a valid explanation to account for the peripheral muscular activity observed during motor imagery. This idea has been corroborated by studies of changes in the excitability of the motor pathways during motor imagery tasks. <span class="citation">Bonnet, Decety, Jeannerod, &amp; Requin (<a href="references.html#ref-bonnet_mental_1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> measured spinal reflexes while participants were instructed to either press a pedal with the foot or to simulate the same action mentally. They observed that both H-reflexes and T-reflexes increased during motor imagery, and that these increases correlated with the force of the simulated pressure. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation and motor evoked potentials (MEPs), several investigators observed muscle-specific increases of MEPs during various motor imagery tasks, while no such increase could be observed in antagonist muscles <span class="citation">(e.g., Fadiga et al., <a href="references.html#ref-fadiga_corticospinal_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>; Rossini, <a href="references.html#ref-rossini_corticospinal_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>


<p>Interestingly, the dominant interpretation of the muscular correlates of motor imagery at the beginning of the last century was that the peripheral muscular activity observed during imagined actions was the <em>source</em> of the mental content. However, as explained by <span class="citation">Jeannerod (<a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, this interpretation of mental processes as a consequence of peripheral feedback is now disproved, for instance by the simple fact that many people can experiment motor imagery, without any observable muscular activity<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. In the most recent theoretical explanations of motor imagery (e.g., MST, emulation or internal models theories), the peripheral activity is rather assumed to be a consequence of an incomplete inhibition of motor output during the mental states involving motor simulation/emulation (i.e., these views adhere to a <em>centralist</em> interpretation of the physiological correlates of inner speech).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Controversial findings</h3>
<p>As reviewed in <span class="citation">Guillot, Lebon, &amp; Collet (<a href="references.html#ref-guillot_electromyographic_2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, although there are many observations showing a peripheral muscular activity during motor imagery, there are also many studies failing to do so, or reporting surprisingly high levels of inter-subject variability, with some participants showing no muscular activity at all. Putting aside the discussion on the exact nature and location of the inhibitory mechanisms during motor imagery <span class="citation">(see Guillot et al., <a href="references.html#ref-guillot_imagining_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, two main explanations have been advanced to resolve these discrepancies. First, the electromyographic activity recorded during motor imagery could be moderated by the perspective taken in motor imagery. We usually make a distinction between a first-person perspective or <em>internal imagery</em> (i.e., imagining an action as we would execute it) and a third-person perspective or <em>external imagery</em> (i.e., imagining an action as an observer of this action), that seem to involve different neural and cognitive processes. It has been shown that a first-person perspective generally results in greater EMG activity than motor imagery in a third-person perspective <span class="citation">(Hale, <a href="references.html#ref-hale_effects_1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>; Harris &amp; Robinson, <a href="references.html#ref-harris_effects_1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span>. Second, some authors postulated that the intensity of the EMG activity recorded during motor imagery might be related to the individual ability to form an accurate mental representation of the motor skill (i.e., the vividness of the mental image). However, after reviewing the available evidence, <span class="citation">Guillot et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-guillot_brain_2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> concluded that this is unlikely to be the case. Alternatively, discrepancies in experimental design and methodological choices (e.g., use of intramuscular versus surface electromyography) could also explain these different results <span class="citation">(Guillot et al., <a href="references.html#ref-guillot_electromyographic_2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we turn to a discussion of inner speech conceptualised as a kind of motor (and sensory) imagery of speech, and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of this proposition as well as the available empirical evidence in its support.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Electromyographic correlates of inner speech production</h3>

<p>A key question: what is the lowest level of specification of inner speech? … figure from oppenheim &amp; dell (2010…)</p>
<p>See MacKay (1992, page 131) for discussion of speaking rate in inner and overt speech… faster rates also occur for other highly trained skills (e.g., tying a shoelace, Annett, 1988)…ref to review of Guillot…</p>

<p>While grasping the concept of a visual image appears as relatively straightforward, it seems more difficult at first to grasp the concept of a motor image, especially when it comes to verbal imagery. The subjective experience of the tension that results from a given position of the articulators and the covert production of an incompatible speech sound permits to substantiate what a motor image is. For instance, it is generally impossible to generate the image of the pronunciation of the sound “b” while keeping the mouth wide opened <span class="citation">(e.g., Binet, <a href="references.html#ref-binet_psychologie_1886" role="doc-biblioref">1886</a>; Stricker, <a href="references.html#ref-stricker_studien_1880" role="doc-biblioref">1880</a>)</span>. This simple experiment allows defining imagined speech as the simulation of the corresponding overt verbal content, where <em>simulation</em> is meant to be understood either as the off-line rehearsal of neural motor networks involved in the overt action <span class="citation">(Jeannerod, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, or in the terms of the emulation theories discussed previously<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The model of wilful (voluntary) inner speech production introduced in <span class="citation">Lœvenbruck et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-loevenbruck_cognitive_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> goes one step further and, by building on the models of speech motor control <span class="citation">(e.g., Houde &amp; Nagarajan, <a href="references.html#ref-houde_speech_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Wolpert et al., <a href="references.html#ref-wolpert_internal_1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, describes inner speech as “multi-modal acts with multi-sensory percepts stemming from coarse multi-sensory goals”. In other words, the auditory and kinaesthetic sensations perceived during inner speech prediction are assumed to be the predicted sensory consequences of speech motor acts, emulated by internal forward models, that use the efference copies issued from an inverse model <span class="citation">(this proposal shares similarities with the emulation model of motor imagery discussed earlier, Grush, <a href="references.html#ref-grush_emulation_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>.</p>

<!-- about levelt model of speech production

However, it does not explicity account for how speech is *regulated* or *monitored* during its production. Speech production theories, in addition to being able to describe how speech is produced, its timecourse and caracteristics, should also be able to explain when and how speech production goes wrong, that is, when and how *speech errros* occur. These theories should also be able to explain how errors can be corrected and how speech, more generally, can be regulated. Several hypotheses have been emitted, that can be grouped under three main classes. Speech might be all programmed in advance, or there would be some *feedback control* during speech, or there would be a combination of both programmation and feedback control.
