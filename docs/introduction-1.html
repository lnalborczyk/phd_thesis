<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The phenomenon of inner speech has been attracting the attention of the philosophical and scientific communities for a long time. This interest might be explained by the paradox surrounding inner speech: while common to everyone and experienced on a daily basis, it is nevertheless arduous to investigate. However, much can be learned about inner speech by investigating its different forms of expression. Among these forms is rumination, which, for several reasons, will be the focus of this paper. First, although rumination is common in general population <span class="citation">(Watkins, Moulds, &amp; Mackintosh, <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_comparisons_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>, it can precede serious mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, or alcohol abuse <span class="citation">(for review, see Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Therefore, understanding the fundamental nature of rumination have important implications for clinical practise. Second, rumination can be induced and sustained for a relatively long period of time, making it easier to capture than more elusive forms of inner speech. With the aim of further exploring the nature of rumination, we present the results of a procedure designed to induce rumination in different modalities (verbal versus visual imagery) and to investigate its modality-specific electromyographic correlates.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Rumination: its definition, functions and consequences</h2>
<p>Rumination can be broadly defined as unconstructive repetitive thinking about past events and current mood states <span class="citation">(Martin &amp; Tesser, <a href="references.html#ref-Martin" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>. This general definition encompasses different conceptualisations that have been proposed during the last decades. Among the most influential frameworks is the <em>Response Style Theory</em> <span class="citation">(RST, Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a><a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Within this theory, rumination is described as a behavioural pattern that is characterised by perseverative, repetitive and passive thoughts. According to the RST, individuals who are experiencing rumination are repetitively focusing on their negative emotional state, on the fact that they are feeling depressed, and on the causes and consequences of their symptoms <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a><a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. In this framework, rumination is viewed as a type of response to distress or a coping mechanism which involves focusing the attention on oneself and one’s current emotional state <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a><a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>. Alloy, Robinson and colleagues <span class="citation">(Alloy et al., <a href="references.html#ref-alloy_temple-wisconsin_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>; Robinson &amp; Alloy, <a href="references.html#ref-Robinson2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Smith &amp; Alloy, <a href="references.html#ref-Smith2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> subsequently appended stress-reactive rumination to this theory, suggesting that rumination can also appear following stressful life events and before the presence of negative affect. When conceptualised in this manner, it is presumed that rumination can occur before the start of the depressive mood, whereas rumination, as conceptualised by <span class="citation">Nolen-Hoeksema (<a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a><a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_responses_1991" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>, happens as a response to depressive mood. Overall, empirical research suggest that negative affect is an essential part of the ruminative thinking process <span class="citation">(e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_effects_1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Based on different factor analyses and more recent models of rumination, a distinction between harmful and helpful sub-types of rumination has been introduced <span class="citation">(e.g., Smith &amp; Alloy, <a href="references.html#ref-Smith2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. For instance, a distinction has been suggested between brooding and reflection <span class="citation">(Treynor et al., <a href="references.html#ref-treynor_rumination_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. Brooding relates to morose pondering along with the passive comparison of one’s current circumstances and a certain standard. In contrast, ruminative reflection denotes contemplation and engagement in cognitive problem solving as a means to mitigate one’s depressive symptoms. In the same vein, <span class="citation">Watkins (<a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> proposed a model for differentiating between harmful and helpful forms of repetitive thought. He argued that repetitive thoughts vary along three dimensions – valence, context and level of construal (abstract versus concrete). By this account, depressive rumination is characterised by an abstract mode of processing that involves thinking about the causes, meaning, and consequences of feelings or events. This abstract-analytic mode is opposed to a more concrete and helpful mode of processing information focused on direct, detailed and concrete experience. The processing mode theory is supported by experimental evidence showing that an abstract-analytical mode of processing is particularly deleterious for mood and cognition <span class="citation">(Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A certain level of overlap between rumination and related constructs such as intrusive thoughts, obsessions or worry has been recognised <span class="citation">(e.g., Olatunji, Naragon-Gainey, &amp; Wolitzky-Taylor, <a href="references.html#ref-olatunji_specificity_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Smith &amp; Alloy, <a href="references.html#ref-Smith2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. Accordingly, rumination and worry have been suggested to represent a particular form of a broader transdiagnostic process coined as <em>unconstructive repetitive thinking</em> <span class="citation">(Olatunji et al., <a href="references.html#ref-olatunji_specificity_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <em>perseverative cognition</em> <span class="citation">(Brosschot, Gerin, &amp; Thayer, <a href="references.html#ref-Brosschot2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> or <em>repetitive negative thinking</em> <span class="citation">(Ehring &amp; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-ehring_repetitive_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. All forms of thinking gathered under these umbrella terms share a broad involvement of self-focused repetitive thinking about negative and self-relevant topics <span class="citation">(De Raedt, Hertel, &amp; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-de_raedt_mechanisms_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. However, one the most important and robust delimitation is the one between worry and rumination. On the whole, it is suggested that worry and rumination can be distinguished by their content and by their temporal orientation <span class="citation">(Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-Watkins2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, but that the <em>processes</em> underlying them would be similar. More precisely, whereas worry is focused on problem solving and future events, (depressive) rumination is rather passive and past-oriented <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Smith &amp; Alloy, <a href="references.html#ref-Smith2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. There are also findings suggesting that worry is typically more verbal than rumination <span class="citation">(Lawrence, Haigh, Siegle, &amp; Schwartz-Mette, <a href="references.html#ref-lawrence_visual_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, although some studies did not find this difference <span class="citation">(Watkins et al., <a href="references.html#ref-watkins_comparisons_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Having briefly defined the functions and consequences of rumination, we now turn to a discussion of the nature of ruminative thinking, its phenomenological properties as well as how it can be induced and measured in a controlled environment.</p>
<!--
The relationship between rumination and depression is a well-established one in adults (Olatunji et al., 2013; Watkins, 2008) as well as in adolescents (Rood et al., 2009). Importantly, the rumination-depression relationship remains significant even when neuroticism, pessimism, perfectionism, and negative cognitive styles are controlled (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008). This association has been explained through several mechanisms, such as negative thinking, poor problem solving, impaired motivation, inhibition of instrumental behavior and reduction in social support (Lyubomirsky & Tkach, 2004; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008). Recently, it has been proposed that rumination is also associated with anxiety, affective disorders, eating disorders, suicidal ideation and signs of post-traumatic stress (Lyubomirsky & Tkach, 2004; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Olatunji et al., 2013).

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> The nature of ruminative thoughts</h2>
<p>Rumination has sometimes been portrayed as a form of <em>inner speech</em> <span class="citation">(Perrone-Bertolotti et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Perrone-Bertolotti2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> due to its predominantly verbal character <span class="citation">(Ehring &amp; Watkins, <a href="references.html#ref-ehring_repetitive_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Goldwin &amp; Behar, <a href="references.html#ref-goldwin_concreteness_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Goldwin, Behar, &amp; Sibrava, <a href="references.html#ref-goldwin_concreteness_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; McLaughlin et al., <a href="references.html#ref-mclaughlin_effects_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. In other words, while ruminating, individuals are most often silently talking to themselves. However, what does inner speech precisely entail is still debated <span class="citation">(for a recent review, see Lœvenbruck et al., <a href="references.html#ref-loevenbruck_cognitive_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. In the present paper, we examine the <em>motor simulation view</em> of inner speech production. Under this view, inner speech (content) is proposed to be the result of a soundless mental simulation of overt speech <span class="citation">(Jeannerod, <a href="references.html#ref-jeannerod_motor_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>; Postma &amp; Noordanus, <a href="references.html#ref-postma_production_1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span>. More precisely, inner is conceived as (inhibited) speech motor acts that trigger –via a <em>simulation</em> or an <em>emulation</em> mechanism– multimodal sensory percepts <span class="citation">(Lœvenbruck et al., <a href="references.html#ref-loevenbruck_cognitive_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. This perspective entails that the speech motor system should be involved during inner speech production and that we could record a peripheral residual activity in the speech muscles. This hypothesis has been corroborated by several studies using orofacial surface electromyography (EMG) during tasks that involve inner speech production such as silent recitation, verbal mental imagery or problem solving <span class="citation">(Jacobson, <a href="references.html#ref-jacobson_electrical_1931" role="doc-biblioref">1931</a>; Livesay et al., <a href="references.html#ref-livesay_covert_1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>; McGuigan &amp; Dollins, <a href="references.html#ref-mcguigan_patterns_1989" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>; Sokolov, <a href="references.html#ref-sokolov_inner_1972" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span>. Overall, these studies show that inner speech production is usually associated with an increased activity of the speech muscles.</p>
<p>We recently conducted a study to examine the facial EMG correlates of rumination <span class="citation">(Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. We have demonstrated that induced rumination is accompanied by an increased facial EMG activity concurrent with increased self-reported levels of state rumination, as compared with an initial relaxed state. This increase in facial EMG activity as a correlate of induced rumination was taken as suggestive evidence that verbal rumination does involve the speech motor system. Furthermore, after a relaxation session focused on the orofacial area, we observed a larger decrease in self-reported state rumination than after non-orofacial (focused on the forearm) relaxation. We interpreted these findings as consistent with the <em>motor simulation view</em>. However, we opened the possibility that participants of this study could have been experiencing rumination in other (non-verbal) modalities, such as rumination in visual mental images. Therefore, the present work is in continuity with our previous study, seeking to further investigate the electromyographic correlates of different rumination modalities (i.e., verbal vs. visual imagery).</p>

-->
<p>Despite being predominantly experienced in a verbal modality, rumination can also be experienced as visual imagery <span class="citation">(Goldwin &amp; Behar, <a href="references.html#ref-goldwin_concreteness_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Newby &amp; Moulds, <a href="references.html#ref-newby_comparison_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Pearson, Brewin, Rhodes, &amp; McCarron, <a href="references.html#ref-pearson_frequency_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Visual imagery refers to a process during which perceptual information is retrieved from long-term memory, resulting in the experience of “seeing with the mind’s eye” <span class="citation">(Ganis, Thompson, &amp; Kosslyn, <a href="references.html#ref-ganis_brain_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. It has been suggested that because rumination is usually past-oriented, it should increase access to (negative) autobiographical memories <span class="citation">(Lyubomirsky, Caldwell, &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-Lyubomirsky1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>. Moreover, because autobiographical memories are often experienced as visual images, rumination should likewise include visual features <span class="citation">(Pearson et al., <a href="references.html#ref-pearson_frequency_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. Several studies have obtained results that are consistent with this claim. Among a sample of patients who were diagnosed as clinically depressed, a significant majority (94.7% and more than 70%) reported that rumination combined verbal and sensory elements, among which visual imagery <span class="citation">(Newby &amp; Moulds, <a href="references.html#ref-newby_comparison_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Pearson et al., <a href="references.html#ref-pearson_frequency_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>, respectively)</span>. When unselected individuals were asked about the quality of their rumination directly while ruminating, 60.53% of them said they had been experiencing verbal thoughts and 35.92% mental images <span class="citation">(McLaughlin et al., <a href="references.html#ref-mclaughlin_effects_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. Another study comparing naturally occurring depressive and anxious thoughts in a non-clinical sample, found that depressive thoughts involved more images than anxious thoughts <span class="citation">(Papageorgiou &amp; Wells, <a href="references.html#ref-papageorgiou_process_1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that a considerable number of people experience depressive cognition in a visual form <span class="citation">(Lawrence et al., <a href="references.html#ref-lawrence_visual_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Furthermore, this study showed that individuals with a visual depressive cognitive style reported a similar amount of rumination as individuals with a verbal style. Overall, the existing literature indicates that rumination can have visual features, despite being predominantly verbal.</p>
<p>There are several reasons to think this distinction is of importance. First of all, mental imagery is usually related to a greater cardiovascular activation than verbal thoughts. This is specifically the case in the stressor-focused concrete visual rumination study, for individuals with high trait rumination <span class="citation">(Zoccola, Rabideau, Figueroa, &amp; Woody, <a href="references.html#ref-zoccola_cardiovascular_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, although a later study found higher heart rate during verbal thoughts <span class="citation">(Woody, Smolak, Rabideau, Figueroa, &amp; Zoccola, <a href="references.html#ref-woody_trait_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Authors interpreted the obtained data by connecting it with the cognitive avoidance theory <span class="citation">(Sibrava &amp; Borkovec, <a href="references.html#ref-davey_cognitive_2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. According to this theory, worry, as a primarily linguistic repetitive thought, is an avoidance response whose goal is to restrain aversive images, thus reducing somatic activation and processing of emotions. Similarly, forming negative mental visual images has been shown to lead to a greater increase in anxiety in comparison to forming negative descriptive sentences <span class="citation">(Holmes &amp; Mathews, <a href="references.html#ref-holmes_mental_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. Taken together, these findings suggest that different modes of rumination could have different effects on individuals. Furthermore, if rumination also has a visual quality, imagery-based therapeutic methods could also be beneficial <span class="citation">(Pearson et al., <a href="references.html#ref-pearson_frequency_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. This idea is supported by studies showing the effectiveness of mental imagery in accessing and modifying emotion in therapy <span class="citation">(for an overview, see Hackmann &amp; Holmes, <a href="references.html#ref-hackmann_reflecting_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. On the whole, investigating the verbal and visual features of rumination could contribute to sharpen our understanding of the ruminative processes and lead to better-adapted therapeutic strategies.</p>

<div id="inducing-rumination-in-a-controlled-environment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Inducing rumination in a controlled environment</h2>
<p>Rumination can be operationalised either as a trait, a stable response style of an individual <span class="citation">(Nolen-Hoeksema, <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a><a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema1991" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span>, or as an ongoing process or a state. When considered as a trait, individual differences in rumination have been mostly investigated by the mean of questionnaires. The most widely used instrument is the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) of the Response Styles Questionnaire <span class="citation">(RSQ, Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, <a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_prospective_1991" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>. Participants are asked to rate how often they encounter these thoughts or behaviours when feeling sad or depressed. The short version of the RRS questionnaire comprises two scales, reflection and brooding <span class="citation">(Treynor et al., <a href="references.html#ref-treynor_rumination_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. The psychometric characteristics of this scale as well as its relationship with depressive symptoms have been extensively studied <span class="citation">(for a review, see Nolen-Hoeksema et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Nolen-Hoeksema2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, self-report measures of rumination have several shortcomings. These measurements can be vulnerable to intents and subjectivity of the participants. They rely on the evaluation of past experience and do not focus on the fact that rumination usually arises in the presence of negative emotion. On the opposite, physiological studies of rumination provide data on rumination as it occurs as well as objective data that are less predisposed to subjective influences. Physiological measures also provide an opportunity to explore underlying mechanisms and central processes <span class="citation">(Siegle &amp; Thayer, <a href="references.html#ref-papageorgiou_physiological_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. For this purpose, several protocols set to induce rumination have been devised.</p>
<p>Experimental protocols for inducing rumination usually start with provoking negative mood in participants. To this end, some researchers employed sad music <span class="citation">(e.g., Conway, Csank, Holm, &amp; Blake, <a href="references.html#ref-conway_assessing_2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, asked participants to recall a sad event <span class="citation">(e.g., Rood et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Rood2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, or put participants in stressful and frustrating situations such as an extremely difficult IQ test <span class="citation">(e.g., Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. Another study tried to cause negative feelings by asking participants to give a speech while being evaluated, though the authors concluded that this stressor was rather mild <span class="citation">(Zoccola et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zoccola_cardiovascular_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. In the following step, rumination is induced. Most studies have employed the rumination induction procedure developed by <span class="citation">Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow (<a href="references.html#ref-nolen-hoeksema_effects_1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. Within this protocol, participants are asked to focus on the meanings, causes, and consequences of their current feelings for eight minutes, while being prompted with a series of sentences. Other studies used either a modified version of this protocol <span class="citation">(e.g., Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> or prompts that were self-devised, but still following the same general idea <span class="citation">(Rood et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Rood2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Zoccola et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zoccola_cardiovascular_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Similarly, in some studies investigating the differences between worry and rumination, participants were given an explanation of what worry or rumination is and were subsequently asked to engage in it <span class="citation">(Goldwin &amp; Behar, <a href="references.html#ref-goldwin_concreteness_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; McLaughlin et al., <a href="references.html#ref-mclaughlin_effects_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<!--
The distinction between verbal and visual rumination is further supported by studies on experimentally induced rumination. For instance, induced depressive rumination is characterised by higher levels of imagery-based activity in comparison to induced worry [@goldwin_concreteness_2012]. Two other studies have specifically focused on the difference between verbal-linguistic thought and visual imagery during rumination [@woody_trait_2015;@zoccola_cardiovascular_2014]. These studies have demonstrated that when people are induced to ruminate in mental visual images, they report higher levels of mental visual images in comparison to participants induced to ruminate verbally. We will discuss their studies in more details below. Overall, the existing literature indicates that rumination can have visual features, despite being predominantly verbal.
-->
<p>Experimental protocols have also used different means for exploring the characteristics of the ongoing process of rumination. In some studies <span class="citation">(e.g., Goldwin &amp; Behar, <a href="references.html#ref-goldwin_concreteness_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; McLaughlin et al., <a href="references.html#ref-mclaughlin_effects_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>, participants were interrupted and asked about the features and/or content of their thoughts. Other studies used questionnaires to measure the features of the ongoing cognition <span class="citation">(Makovac et al., <a href="references.html#ref-makovac_verbal_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Among other characteristics, several studies explored how much the ongoing inner experience was verbal and visual, without manipulating rumination modality. In a few studies, however, experimental protocols have been specifically set out to manipulate this aspect of rumination.</p>
<p>Some of the few studies specifically manipulating verbal and visual rumination were carried out by Zoccola and colleagues <span class="citation">(Woody et al., <a href="references.html#ref-woody_trait_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Zoccola et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zoccola_cardiovascular_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. The verbal or visual form of rumination (or <em>mentation type</em> as these authors refer to it) was induced by playing audio tapes that directed participants’ thoughts. Prompts were similar in both conditions, differing only in the verbal/visual instruction (“Recall the speech task using words, phrases, and sentences.” vs. “Recall the speech task using pictures and images.”). Participants were subsequently asked to estimate the proportion of verbal thoughts and mental visual images. Although not directly focused on rumination, the task developed by <span class="citation">Holmes, Mathews, Mackintosh, &amp; Dalgleish (<a href="references.html#ref-holmes_causal_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> is quite inspiring in designing a protocol for exploring rumination in different modalities. These authors aimed to compare verbal and imagery processing in terms of their differential effects on emotion. They noticed that previous procedures provided verbal descriptions of the events that needed to be processed verbally or visually. The authors argued that with such descriptions, the imagery condition has an additional processing mode in comparison to the. Their proposed solution was to combine pictorial and verbal cues and to ask participants to integrate them into either a sentence or an image.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that in none of the studies in which thinking modality was manipulated, did the participants solely use one type of thought. Even though participants in the imagery group of <span class="citation">Zoccola et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-zoccola_cardiovascular_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> reported higher levels of mental images in comparison to the participants in the verbal group, the later group also reported a certain level of mental imagery. This is in line with studies showing that rumination includes both verbal and visual components <span class="citation">(e.g., Goldwin &amp; Behar, <a href="references.html#ref-goldwin_concreteness_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; McLaughlin et al., <a href="references.html#ref-mclaughlin_effects_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>, implying that it is not exclusively experienced in one modality. These results are substantiated by a recent study which has shown that participants generate visual images both in cases where they were told to visualise or to verbally think, while they have strong verbal representations only when asked to verbally think <span class="citation">(Amit, Hoeflin, Hamzah, &amp; Fedorenko, <a href="references.html#ref-amit_asymmetrical_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Amit et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-amit_asymmetrical_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> concluded that there is a difference in volitional control of verbal and visual thinking and that people have better control over inner speech than visual thought. Therefore, we will focus on the relative use of a specific mode of thought rather than trying to induce completely verbal or visual thought.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> The present study</h2>

Furthermore, there has only been one set of studies, to the best of our knowledge, that has employed a protocol for specifically inducing verbal or visual rumination <span class="citation">(Woody et al., <a href="references.html#ref-woody_trait_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Zoccola et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zoccola_cardiovascular_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. In addition, there were certain shortcomings in this protocol, some of which were highlighted by the authors, such as the stress induction component. To tackle these problems, we extended the study presented in <span class="citation">Nalborczyk et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> by inducing rumination in distinct modalities to compare their electromyographic correlates.</p>
<p>As previously <span class="citation">(Nalborczyk et al., <a href="references.html#ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, we followed two steps in our protocol. First, either verbal or visual rumination was induced in participants by putting them in a stressful situation and subsequently asking them to think about the causes, consequences of their feelings during that situation. Based on the task developed by <span class="citation">Holmes et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-holmes_causal_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, instructions were presented by combining pictorial and verbal cues. During this period, we tracked changes in the EMG activity of several facial muscles and monitored self-reported levels of state rumination. Second, we compared the effects of two types of relaxation in relation to the modality of ruminative thoughts, on both the EMG amplitude and the self-reported levels of state rumination.</p>
<p>Several hypotheses were drawn based on the existing literature. First, we expected participants in the verbal rumination condition to report a larger proportion of verbal content in their inner experience and a lesser amount of visual content (in comparison to participants in the non-verbal rumination group). Second, with respect to peripheral muscular activity, we expected the activity in the speech muscles to increase by a greater amount in the verbal rumination condition, whereas the change in the non-speech muscles should occur similarly in both conditions, since both conditions are expected to cause negative emotions to a similar extent. Moreover, the control forearm muscle activity should not vary distinctively between conditions. Third, regarding the different types of relaxation, we hypothesised that both orofacial and arm relaxation should cause a slight decrease of state rumination in the verbal condition. Nevertheless, we expected a stronger decrease in the orofacial relaxation condition as compared to the forearm relaxation.</p>
